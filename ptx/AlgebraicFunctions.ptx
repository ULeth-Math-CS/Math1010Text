  <title>Algebraic Functions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      This section serves as a watershed for functions which are combinations of polynomial,
      and more generally,
      rational functions, with the operations of radicals.
      It is business of Calculus to discuss these functions in all the detail they demand so our aim in this section is to help shore up the requisite skills needed so that the reader can answer Calculus's call when the time comes.
      We briefly recall the definition and some of the basic properties of radicals.
      Although we discussed imaginary numbers in <xref ref="ComplexZeros">Section</xref>,
      we restrict our attention to real numbers in this section.
      See the epilogue on <xref ref="complexepilogue">page</xref> for more details.
      Recall that we defined the principal
      <m>n^{\textrm{th} }</m> root in <xref ref="principalnthrootdefn">Definition</xref>.
      We repeat the definition here for convenience.

      <title>Principal $n^{\textrm{th}}$ root</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>x</m> be a real number and <m>n</m> a natural number.
          If <m>n</m> is odd, the
              <idx><h><m>n^{\textrm{th} }</m> root</h><h>principal</h></idx><idx><h>principal <m>n^{\textrm{th} }</m> root</h></idx>
          <term>principal <m>n^{\textrm{th} }</m> root</term> of <m>x</m>,
          denoted <m>\sqrt[n]{x}</m> is the unique real number satisfying <m>\left(\sqrt[n]{x}\right)^n = x</m>.
          If <m>n</m> is even, <m>\sqrt[n]{x}</m> is defined similarly provided
          <m>x \geq 0</m> and <m>\sqrt[n]{x} \geq 0</m>.

          For <m>n=2</m>,
          we write <m>\sqrt{x}</m> instead of <m>\sqrt[2]{x}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <aside>
      <p>
        When <m>n</m> is even, it is necessary to specify that the principal
        <m>n^\textrm{th}</m> root is non-negative for it to be uniquely defined.
        For example,
        both <m>x=-2</m> and <m>x=2</m> satisfy <m>x^4=16</m>,
        but <m>\sqrt[4]{16} =2</m>, not <m>-2</m>.
      </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      It is worth remarking that,
      in light of <xref ref="InverseFunctions">Section</xref>,
      we could define <m>f(x) = \sqrt[n]{x}</m> functionally as the inverse of
      <m>g(x) = x^n</m> with the stipulation that when <m>n</m> is even,
      the domain of <m>g</m> is restricted to <m>[0, \infty)</m>.
      From what we know about <m>g(x) = x^n</m> from <xref ref="GraphsofPolynomials">Section</xref>
      along with <xref ref="inverseuniquegraph">Theorem</xref>,
      we can produce the graphs of
      <m>f(x) = \sqrt[n]{x}</m> by reflecting the graphs of
      <m>g(x) = x^n</m> across the line <m>y=x</m>.
      <xref ref="fig_algfun1">Figure</xref>
      shows the graphs of <m>y=\sqrt{x}</m>,
      <m>y=\sqrt[4]{x}</m> and <m>y=\sqrt[6]{x}</m>.
      The point <m>(0,0)</m> is indicated as a reference.
      The axes are hidden so we can see the vertical steepening near <m>x=0</m> and the horizontal flattening as <m>x \rightarrow \infty</m>.

      The odd-indexed radical functions also follow a predictable trend - steepening near <m>x = 0</m> and flattening as <m>x \rightarrow \pm \infty</m>,
      as seen in <xref ref="fig_algfun2">Figure</xref>.
      In the exercises,
      you'll have a chance to graph some basic radical functions using the techniques presented in <xref ref="Transformations">Section</xref>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next, we recall the properties of radicals given in <xref ref="radicalprops">Definition</xref>.
      We have used all of these properties at some point in the textbook for the case <m>n=2</m>
      (the square root),
      but we repeat them here in generality for completeness.

          </ul>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      The proof of <xref ref="radicalprops2">Theorem</xref>
      is based on the definition of the principal roots and properties of exponents.
      To establish the product rule, consider the following.
      If <m>n</m> is odd, then by definition
      <m>\sqrt[n]{xy}</m> is the unique real number such that <m>(\sqrt[n]{xy})^{n} = xy</m>.
      Given that <m>\left( \sqrt[n]{x} \, \sqrt[n]{y}\right)^n = \left(\sqrt[n]{x}\right)^n \left(\sqrt[n]{y}\right)^n = xy</m>,
      it must be the case that <m>\sqrt[n]{xy} = \sqrt[n]{x} \, \sqrt[n]{y}</m>.
      If <m>n</m> is even, then
      <m>\sqrt[n]{xy}</m> is the unique non-negative real number such that <m>(\sqrt[n]{xy})^{n} = xy</m>.
      Also note that since <m>n</m> is even,
      <m>\sqrt[n]{x}</m> and <m>\sqrt[n]{y}</m> are also non-negative and hence so is <m>\sqrt[n]{x}\sqrt[n]{y}</m>.
      Proceeding as above,
      we find that <m>\sqrt[n]{xy} = \sqrt[n]{x} \, \sqrt[n]{y}</m>.
      The quotient rule is proved similarly and is left as an exercise.
      The power rule results from repeated application of the product rule,
      so long as <m>\sqrt[n]{x}</m> is a real number to start with.(Otherwise we'd run into the same paradox we did in <xref ref="ComplexZeros">Section</xref>.) The last property is an application of the power rule when <m>n</m> is odd,
      and the occurrence of the absolute value when <m>n</m> is even is due to the requirement that
      <m>\sqrt[n]{x} \geq 0</m> in <xref ref="principalnthrootdefn2">Definition</xref>.
      For instance,
      <m>\sqrt[4]{(-2)^4} = \sqrt[4]{16}= 2 = |-2|</m>, not <m>-2</m>.
      It's this last property which makes compositions of roots and powers delicate.
      This is especially true when we use exponential notation for radicals.
      Recall the following definition,
      first given in <xref ref="rationalexponentdefn">Definition</xref>.

            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      The rational exponents defined in <xref ref="rationalexponentdefn2">Definition</xref>
      behave very similarly to the usual integer exponents from Elementary Algebra with one critical exception.
      Consider the expression <m>\left(x^{2/3}\right)^{3/2}</m>.
      Applying the usual laws of exponents,
      we'd be tempted to simplify this as <m>\left(x^{2/3}\right)^{3/2} = x^{\frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{3}{2}} = x^{1} = x</m>.
      However, if we substitute <m>x=-1</m> and apply <xref ref="rationalexponentdefn2">Definition</xref>,
      we find <m>(-1)^{2/3} = \left(\sqrt[3]{-1}\right)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1</m> so that <m>\left((-1)^{2/3}\right)^{3/2} = 1^{3/2} = \left(\sqrt{1}\right)^3 = 1^3 = 1</m>.
      We see in this case that <m>\left(x^{2/3}\right)^{3/2} \neq x</m>.
      If we take the time to rewrite
      <m>\left(x^{2/3}\right)^{3/2}</m> with radicals, we see
      <me>
        \left(x^{2/3}\right)^{3/2} = \left(\left(\sqrt[3]{x}\right)^2\right)^{3/2} =  \left(\sqrt{\left(\sqrt[3]{x}\right)^2}\right)^3 =\left(\left|\sqrt[3]{x}\right|\right)^3 = \left| \left(\sqrt[3]{x}\right)^3  \right| = |x|
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      In the play-by-play analysis,
      we see that when we cancelled the <m>2</m>'s in multiplying <m>\frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{3}{2}</m>, we were,
      in fact, attempting to cancel a square with a square root.
      The fact that <m>\sqrt{x^2} = |x|</m> and not simply <m>x</m> is the root of the trouble. (Pun intended.) It may amuse the reader to know that <m>\left(x^{3/2}\right)^{2/3} = x</m>,
      and this verification is left as an exercise.
      The moral of the story is that when simplifying fractional exponents,
      it's usually best to rewrite them as radicals. (In most other cases, though,
      rational exponents are preferred.) The last major property we will state,
      and leave to Calculus to prove,
      is that radical functions are continuous on their domains,
      so the Intermediate Value Theorem,
      <xref ref="IVT">Theorem</xref>, applies.
      This means that if we take combinations of radical functions with polynomial and rational functions to form what the authors consider
          <idx><h>function</h><h>algebraic</h></idx>
      the <em>algebraic functions</em>,
      we can make sign diagrams using the procedure set forth in <xref ref="RationalGraphs">Section</xref>.

                and where the graph of <m>f</m> is below the <m>x</m>-axis we have that <m>f</m> is <m>(-)</m>.
                Plotting the function in GeoGebra,

                You'll have to wait until Calculus to fully understand this phenomenon.

                we have two radicals both of which are even indexed.
                To satisfy <m>\sqrt[4]{x+3}</m>,
                we require <m>x+3 \geq 0</m> or <m>x \geq -3</m>.
                To satisfy <m>\sqrt{2-\sqrt[4]{x+3}}</m>,
                we need <m>2-\sqrt[4]{x+3} \geq 0</m>.
                While it may be tempting to write this as
                <m>2 \geq \sqrt[4]{x+3}</m> and take both sides to the fourth power,
                there are times when this technique will produce erroneous results. (For instance,
                <m>-2 \geq \sqrt[4]{x+3}</m>,
                which has no solution or
          <m>-2 \leq \sqrt[4]{x+3}</m> whose solution is <m>[-3,\infty)</m>.) Instead,
                we solve <m>2-\sqrt[4]{x+3} \geq 0</m> using a sign diagram.
                If we let <m>r(x) = 2-\sqrt[4]{x+3}</m>, we know <m>x \geq -3</m>,
                so we concern ourselves with only this portion of the number line.
                To find the zeros of <m>r</m> we set <m>r(x) =0</m> and solve <m>2-\sqrt[4]{x+3}=0</m>.
                We get <m>\sqrt[4]{x+3} = 2</m> so that
                <m>\left(\sqrt[4]{x+3}\right)^4 = 2^4</m> from which we obtain <m>x+3 = 16</m> or <m>x=13</m>.
                Since we raised both sides of an equation to an even power,
                we need to check to see if <m>x=13</m> is an extraneous solution. (Recall that this means we have produced a candidate which doesn't satisfy the original equation.
                Do you remember how raising both sides of an equation to an even power could cause this?) We find <m>x=13</m> does check since <m>2-\sqrt[4]{x+3} = 2 - \sqrt[4]{13+3} = 2 - \sqrt[4]{16} = 2 - 2 = 0</m>.
                Our sign diagram for <m>r</m> is given in <xref ref="fig_algfun4">Figure</xref>. <figure xml:id="fig_algfun4"> <caption>Sign diagram for
                <m>r(x)=2-\sqrt[4]{x+3}</m></caption> <image source="figures/FurtherGraphics/AlgebraicFunctions-8"></image> </figure> We find
                <m>2-\sqrt[4]{x+3} \geq 0</m> on <m>[-3,13]</m> so this is the domain of <m>g</m>.
                To find a sign diagram for <m>g</m>,
                we look for the zeros of <m>g</m>.
                Setting <m>g(x) = 0</m> is equivalent to <m>\sqrt{2-\sqrt[4]{x+3}}=0</m>.
                After squaring both sides,
                we get <m>2-\sqrt[4]{x+3} = 0</m>,
                whose solution we have found to be <m>x=13</m>.
                Since we squared both sides,
                we double check and find <m>g(13)</m> is, in fact,
          <m>0</m>.
                Our sign diagram and graph of <m>g</m> are below.
                Since the domain of <m>g</m> is <m>[-3,13]</m>,
                what we have below is not just a
                <em>portion</em> of the graph of <m>g</m>,
                but the <em>complete</em> graph.
                It is always above or on the <m>x</m>-axis,
                which verifies our sign diagram:
                see <xref ref="fig_algfun5">Figure</xref>. <table xml:id="fig_algfun5"> <caption><m>g(x)=\sqrt{2-\sqrt[4]{x+3}}</m></caption> <tabular> <row> <cell><image source="figures/FurtherGraphics/AlgebraicFunctions-9"></image></cell> </row> <row> <cell>Sign diagram for <m>g(x)</m></cell> </row> <row> <cell></cell> </row> <row> <cell><image source="figures/FurtherGraphics/Algebraic02"></image></cell> </row> <row> <cell>Complete graph of <m>y=g(x)</m></cell> </row> </tabular> </table>

                The radical in <m>h(x)</m> is odd,
                so our only concern is the denominator.
                Setting <m>x+1=0</m> gives <m>x=-1</m>,
                so our domain is <m>(-\infty, -1) \cup (-1, \infty)</m>.
                To find the zeros of <m>h</m>, we set <m>h(x) = 0</m>.
                To solve <m>\sqrt[3]{\frac{8x}{x+1}} = 0</m>,
                we cube both sides to get <m>\frac{8x}{x+1} = 0</m>.
                We get <m>8x=0</m>, or <m>x=0</m>.
                Below is the resulting sign diagram and corresponding graph.
                From the graph,
                it appears as though <m>x=-1</m> is a vertical asymptote.
                Carrying out an analysis as
                <m>x \rightarrow -1</m> as in <xref ref="RationalGraphs">Section</xref>
                confirms this. (We leave the details to the reader.) Near <m>x=0</m>,
                we have a situation similar to <m>x=2</m> in the graph of <m>f</m> in number 1 above.
                Finally,
          it appears as if the graph of <m>h</m> has a horizontal asymptote <m>y=2</m>.
                Using techniques from <xref ref="RationalGraphs">Section</xref>,
                we find as <m>x \rightarrow \pm \infty</m>,
                <m>\frac{8x}{x+1} \rightarrow 8</m>.
                From this,
          it is hardly surprising that as <m>x \rightarrow \pm \infty</m>,
                <m>h(x) = \sqrt[3]{\frac{8x}{x+1}} \approx \sqrt[3]{8} =2</m>.
                The sign diagram and graph for <m>h</m> are given in <xref ref="fig_algfun6">Figure</xref>. <table xml:id="fig_algfun6"> <caption><m>h(x)=\sqrt[3]{\dfrac{8x}{x+1}}</m></caption> <tabular> <row> <cell><image source="figures/FurtherGraphics/AlgebraicFunctions-10"></image></cell> </row> <row> <cell>Sign diagram for <m>h(x)</m></cell> </row> <row> <cell></cell> </row> <row> <cell><image source="figures/FurtherGraphics/Algebraic03"></image></cell> </row> <row> <cell>Graph of <m>y=h(x)</m></cell> </row> </tabular> </table>

              <p>
                To find the domain of <m>k</m>,
                we have both an even root and a denominator to concern ourselves with.
                To satisfy the square root, <m>x^2 - 1 \geq 0</m>.
                Setting <m>r(x) = x^2-1</m>,
                we find the zeros of <m>r</m> to be <m>x = \pm 1</m>,
                and we find the sign diagram of <m>r</m> shown in <xref ref="fig_algfun7">Figure</xref>. <figure xml:id="fig_algfun7"> <caption>The sign diagram of
                <m>r(x)=x^2-1</m></caption> <image source="figures/FurtherGraphics/AlgebraicFunctions-11"></image> </figure> We find
                <m>x^2 - 1 \geq 0</m> for <m>(-\infty, -1] \cup [1, \infty)</m>.
                To keep the denominator of <m>k(x)</m> away from zero,
                we set <m>\sqrt{x^2-1} = 0</m>.
                We leave it to the reader to verify the solutions are <m>x = \pm 1</m>,
                both of which must be excluded from the domain.
                Hence,
          the domain of <m>k</m> is <m>(-\infty, -1) \cup (1,\infty)</m>.
                To build the sign diagram for <m>k</m>,
                we need the zeros of <m>k</m>.
                Setting <m>k(x) = 0</m> results in <m>\frac{2x}{\sqrt{x^2 - 1}}= 0</m>.
                We get <m>2x =0</m> or <m>x=0</m>.
                However, <m>x=0</m> isn't in the domain of <m>k</m>,
                which means <m>k</m> has no zeros.
                We construct our sign diagram on the domain of <m>k</m> in <xref ref="fig_algfun8">Figure</xref>
                along with the graph of <m>k</m>.
                It appears that the graph of <m>k</m> has two vertical asymptotes,
                one at <m>x=-1</m> and one at <m>x=1</m>.
                The gap in the graph between the asymptotes is because of the gap in the domain of <m>k</m>.
                Concerning end behaviour,
                there appear to be two horizontal asymptotes,
                <m>y = 2</m> and <m>y=-2</m>.
                To see why this is the case,
                we think of <m>x\rightarrow \pm \infty</m>.
                The radicand of the denominator <m>x^2 - 1 \approx x^2</m>,
                and as such,
                <m>k(x) = \frac{2x}{\sqrt{x^2 - 1}} \approx \frac{2x}{\sqrt{x^2}} = \frac{2x}{|x|}</m>.
                As <m>x \rightarrow \infty</m>,
                we have <m>|x| = x</m> so <m>k(x) \approx \frac{2x}{x} = 2</m>.
                On the other hand, as <m>x \rightarrow -\infty</m>,
          <m>|x| = -x</m>,
                and as such <m>k(x) \approx \frac{2x}{-x} = -2</m>.
                Finally,
          it appears as though the graph of <m>k</m> passes the Horizontal Line Test which means <m>k</m> is one to one and <m>k^{-1}</m> exists.
                Computing <m>k^{-1}</m> is left as an exercise. <table xml:id="fig_algfun8"> <caption><m>k(x)=\dfrac{2x}{\sqrt{x^2-1}}</m></caption> <tabular> <row> <cell><image source="figures/FurtherGraphics/AlgebraicFunctions-12"></image></cell> </row> <row> <cell>Sign diagram for <m>k(x)</m></cell> </row> <row> <cell></cell> </row> <row> <cell><image source="figures/FurtherGraphics/Algebraic04"></image></cell> </row> <row> <cell>Graph of <m>y=k(x)</m></cell> </row> </tabular> </table>

    <p>
      As the previous example illustrates,
      the graphs of general algebraic functions can have features we've seen before,
      like vertical and horizontal asymptotes,
      but they can occur in new and exciting ways.
      For example,
      <m>k(x) = \frac{2x}{\sqrt{x^{2} - 1}}</m> had two distinct horizontal asymptotes.
      You'll recall that rational functions could have at most one horizontal asymptote.
      Also some new characteristics like
      <q>unusual steepness</q>
      (the proper Calculus term for this is <q>vertical tangent</q>,
      but for now we'll be okay calling it
      <q>unusual steepness</q>)
      and cusps
      (see <xref ref="cusppicture">page</xref>
      for the first reference to this feature)
      can appear in the graphs of arbitrary algebraic functions.
      Our next example first demonstrates how we can use sign diagrams to solve nonlinear inequalities. (Don't panic.
      The technique is very similar to the ones used in <xref ref="LinearQuadratic">Chapters</xref>,
      <xref ref="Polynomials"></xref> and <xref ref="Rationals"></xref>.) We then check our answers graphically with a calculator and see some of the new graphical features of the functions in this extended family.

                To solve <m>x^{2/3} \lt x^{4/3} - 6</m>,
                we get <m>0</m> on one side and attempt to solve <m>x^{4/3} - x^{2/3} - 6 > 0</m>.
                We set <m>r(x) = x^{4/3} - x^{2/3} - 6</m> and note that since the denominators in the exponents are <m>3</m>,
                they correspond to cube roots,
                which means the domain of <m>r</m> is <m>(-\infty, \infty)</m>.
                To find the zeros for the sign diagram,
                we set <m>r(x) = 0</m> and attempt to solve <m>x^{4/3} - x^{2/3} - 6 = 0</m>.
                At this point, it may be unclear how to proceed.
                We could always try as a last resort converting back to radical notation,
                but in this case we can take a cue from <xref ref="usubex">Example</xref>.
                Since there are three terms,
                and the exponent on one of the variable terms,
                <m>x^{4/3}</m>,
                is exactly twice that of the other, <m>x^{2/3}</m>,
                we have ourselves a <q>quadratic in disguise</q>
                and we can rewrite <m>x^{4/3} - x^{2/3} - 6 = 0</m> as <m>\left(x^{2/3}\right)^2 - x^{2/3} - 6=0</m>.
                If we let <m>u = x^{2/3}</m>,
                then in terms of <m>u</m>,
          we get <m>u^2 - u - 6 = 0</m>.
                Solving for <m>u</m>, we obtain <m>u = -2</m> or <m>u = 3</m>.
                Replacing <m>x^{2/3}</m> back in for <m>u</m>,
                we get <m>x^{2/3} = -2</m> or <m>x^{2/3} = 3</m>.
                To avoid the trouble we encountered in the discussion following <xref ref="rationalexponentdefn">Definition</xref>,
                we now convert back to radical notation.
                By interpreting <m>x^{2/3}</m> as <m>\sqrt[3]{x^2}</m> we have
                <m>\sqrt[3]{x^2} = -2</m> or <m>\sqrt[3]{x^2}= 3</m>.
                Cubing both sides of these equations results in <m>x^2 = -8</m>,
                which admits no real solution,
                or <m>x^2 = 27</m>, which gives <m>x = \pm 3 \sqrt{3}</m>.
                We construct a sign diagram and find
                <m>x^{4/3} - x^{2/3} - 6 > 0</m> on <m>\left(-\infty, -3 \sqrt{3}\right)\cup \left(3 \sqrt{3}, \infty\right)</m>.
                To check our answer graphically,
                we set <m>f(x) = x^{2/3}</m> and <m>g(x) = x^{4/3}-6</m>.
                The solution to <m>x^{2/3} \lt x^{4/3} - 6</m> corresponds to the inequality <m>f(x) \lt g(x)</m>,
                which means we are looking for the <m>x</m> values for which the graph of <m>f</m> is below the graph of <m>g</m>.
                Using the <q>Intersect</q> tool we confirm
                (or at least, confirm to a few decimal places)
                that the graphs cross at <m>x= \pm 3\sqrt{3}</m>.
                We see in <xref ref="fig_algfun9">Figure</xref> that the graph of <m>f</m>

                that despite the fact they both involve cube roots,
                they exhibit different behaviour near <m>x=0</m>.

          the negative exponent on the second term indicates a denominator.
                Rewriting <m>r(x)</m> with positive exponents, we obtain
                <me>
                  r(x) =  3 (2-x)^{1/3} - \frac{x}{(2-x)^{2/3}}
                </me>
                Setting the denominator equal to zero we get <m>(2-x)^{2/3} = 0</m>,
                or <m>\sqrt[3]{(2-x)^2} = 0</m>.
                After cubing both sides,
                and subsequently taking square roots,
                we get <m>2-x=0</m>, or <m>x=2</m>.
                Hence,
          the domain of <m>r</m> is <m>(-\infty, 2) \cup (2, \infty)</m>.
                To find the zeros of <m>r</m>, we set <m>r(x) = 0</m>.
                There are two school of thought on how to proceed and we demonstrate both.

                      <em>Factoring Approach.</em>
                      From <m>r(x) = 3 (2-x)^{1/3} - x (2-x)^{-2/3}</m>,
                      we note that the quantity <m>(2-x)</m> is common to both terms.
                      When we factor out common factors,
                      we factor out the quantity with the
                      <em>smaller</em> exponent.
                      In this case, since <m>-\frac{2}{3} \lt  \frac{1}{3}</m>,
                      we factor <m>(2-x)^{-2/3}</m> from both quantities.
                      While it may seem odd to do so,
                      we need to factor <m>(2-x)^{-2/3}</m>
                      <em>from</em> <m>(2-x)^{1/3}</m>,
                      which results in subtracting the exponent
                      <m>-\frac{2}{3}</m> from <m>\frac{1}{3}</m>.
                      We proceed using the usual properties of exponents. (And we exercise special care when reducing the <m>\frac{3}{3}</m> power to <m>1</m>.)

              Use your calculator to graph <m>y=C(x)</m> on its domain.
              What is the minimum cost?
              How far along Route <m>117</m> should the cable be run before turning off of the road?
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                The cost is broken into two parts:
                the cost to run cable along Route <m>117</m> at <m>\dollar15</m> per mile,
                and the cost to run it off road at <m>\dollar20</m> per mile.
                Since <m>x</m> represents the miles of cable run along Route <m>117</m>,
                the cost  for that portion is <m>15x</m>.
                From the diagram,
                we see that the number of miles the cable is run off road is <m>z</m>,
                so the cost of that portion is <m>20z</m>.
                Hence, the total cost is <m>C = 15x + 20z</m>.
                Our next goal is to determine <m>z</m> as a function of <m>x</m>.
                The diagram suggests we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to get <m>y^2+30^2 = z^2</m>.
                But we also see <m>x+y = 50</m> so that <m>y=50-x</m>.
                Hence, <m>z^2 = (50-x)^2+900</m>.
                Solving for <m>z</m>, we obtain <m>z = \pm \sqrt{(50-x)^2+900}</m>.
                Since <m>z</m> represents a distance,
                we choose <m>z = \sqrt{(50-x)^2+900}</m> so that our cost as a function of <m>x</m> only is given by
                <me>
                  C(x) = 15x + 20\sqrt{(50-x)^2+900}
                </me>
                From the context of the problem,
                we have <m>0 \leq x \leq 50</m>.
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                Graphing <m>y=C(x)</m> on a calculator and using the
                <q>Minimum</q> feature,
                we find the relative minimum
                (which is also the absolute minimum in this case)
                to two decimal places to be <m>(15.98, 1146.86)</m>.
                Here the <m>x</m>-coordinate tells us that in order to minimize cost,
                we should run <m>15.98</m> miles of cable along Route 117 and then turn off of the road and head towards the outpost.
                The <m>y</m>-coordinate tells us that the minimum cost,
                in dollars,
                to do so is <m>\dollar1146.86</m>.

          The calculator gives the absolute minimum at <m>\approx (18.66, 582.29)</m>.
          This means to minimize the cost,
          approximately 18.66 miles of cable should be run along Route 117 before turning off the road and heading towards the outpost.
          The minimum cost to run the cable is approximately <m>\dollar582.29</m>.
