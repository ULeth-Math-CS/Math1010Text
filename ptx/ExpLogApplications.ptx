  <title>Applications of Exponential and Logarithmic Functions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      As we mentioned in <xref ref="IntroExpLogs">Section</xref>,
      exponential and logarithmic functions are used to model a wide variety of behaviours in the real world.
      In the examples that follow,
      note that while the applications are drawn from many different disciplines,
      the mathematics remains essentially the same.
      Due to the applied nature of the problems we will examine in this section,
      the calculator is often used to express our answers as decimal approximations.

    <title>Applications of Exponential Functions</title>
    <p>
      Perhaps the most well-known application of exponential functions comes from the financial world.
      Suppose you have <m>\dollar 100</m> to invest at your local bank and they are offering a whopping <m>5 \, \%</m> annual percentage interest rate.
      This means that after one year,
      the bank will pay <em>you</em>
      <m>5 \%</m> of that <m>\dollar100</m>,
      or <m>\dollar 100(0.05) =\dollar 5</m> in interest,
      so you now have <m>\dollar105</m>. (How generous of them!) This is in accordance with the formula for
      <em>simple interest</em>
      which you have undoubtedly run across at some point before.

    <p>
      Suppose, however, that six months into the year,
      you hear of a better deal at a rival bank. (Some restrictions may apply.) Naturally,
      you withdraw your money and try to invest it at the higher rate there.
      Since six months is one half of a year,
      that initial <m>\dollar100</m> yields <m>\dollar100(0.05)\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \dollar 2.50</m> in interest.
      You take your <m>\dollar102.50</m> off to the competitor and find out that those restrictions which <em>may</em>
      apply actually <em>do</em> apply to you,
      and you return to your bank which happily accepts your
      <m>\dollar102.50</m> for the remaining six months of the year.
      To your surprise and delight,
      at the end of the year your statement reads <m>\dollar105.06</m>,
      not <m>\dollar105</m> as you had expected. (Actually,
      the final balance should be
      <m>\dollar105.0625</m>.) Where did those extra six cents come from?
      For the first six months of the year,
      interest was earned on the original principal of <m>\dollar100</m>,
      but for the second six months,
      interest was earned on <m>\dollar102.50</m>, that is,
      you earned interest on your interest.
      This is the basic concept behind
      <em>compound interest</em>.
      In the previous discussion,
      we would say that the interest was compounded twice,
      or semiannually. (Using this convention,
      simple interest after one year is the same as compounding the interest only once.) If more money can be earned by earning interest on interest already earned,
      a natural question to ask is what happens if the interest is compounded more often,
      say <m>4</m> times a year,
      which is every three months,
      or <q>quarterly.</q> In this case,
      the money is in the account for three months,
      or <m>\frac{1}{4}</m> of a year, at a time.
      After the first quarter,
      we have <m>A = P(1+rt) = \dollar100 \left(1 + 0.05 \cdot \frac{1}{4} \right) = \dollar101.25</m>.
      We now invest the <m>\dollar101.25</m> for the next three months and find that at the end of the second quarter,
      we have <m>A = \dollar101.25 \left(1 + 0.05 \cdot \frac{1}{4} \right)\approx \dollar102.51</m>.
      Continuing in this manner,
      the balance at the end of the third quarter is <m>\dollar103.79</m>,
      and, at last,
      we obtain <m>\dollar105.08</m>.
      The extra two cents hardly seems worth it,
      but we see that we do in fact get more money the more often we compound.
      In order to develop a formula for this phenomenon,
      we need to do some abstract calculations.
      Suppose we wish to invest our principal <m>P</m> at an annual rate <m>r</m> and compound the interest <m>n</m> times per year.
      This means the money sits in the account
      <m>\frac{1}{n}^{\text{ th } }</m> of a year between compoundings.
      Let <m>A_{k}</m> denote the amount in the account after the <m>k^{\text{ th } }</m> compounding.
      Then <m>A_{1} = P\left(1 + r\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)\right)</m> which simplifies to <m>A_{1} = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)</m>.
      After the second compounding,
      we use <m>A_{1}</m> as our new principal and get <m>A_{2} = A_{1} \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right) = \left[P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)\right]\left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right) = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^2</m>.
      Continuing in this fashion,
      we get <m>A_{3} =P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^3</m>,
      <m>A_{4} =P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^4</m>, and so on,
      so that <m>A_{k} = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^k</m>.
      Since we compound the interest <m>n</m> times per year,
      after <m>t</m> years, we have <m>nt</m> compoundings.
      We have just derived the general formula for compound interest below.

      If we take <m>P = 100</m>, <m>r = 0.05</m>, and <m>n = 4</m>,
      <xref ref="compoundinterest">Equation</xref>

      To check this new formula against our previous calculations,
      we find <m>A\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) = 100(1.0125)^{4 \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)} = 101.25</m>,

                <m>r = 0.07125</m>, and <m>n = 12</m>

                Since <m>t</m> represents the length of the investment in years,
                we substitute <m>t=5</m> into <m>A(t)</m> to find <m>A(5) = 2000 (1.0059375)^{12(5)} \approx 2852.92</m>.

                Our initial investment is <m>\dollar2000</m>,
                so to find the time it takes this to double,
                we need to find <m>t</m> when <m>A(t) = 4000</m>.
                We get <m>2000 (1.0059375)^{12t}=4000</m>,
                or <m>(1.0059375)^{12t}=2</m>.
                Taking natural logs as in <xref ref="ExpEquations">Section</xref>,
                we get <m>t = \frac{\ln(2)}{12 \ln(1.0059375)} \approx 9.75</m>.
                Hence,
          it takes approximately <m>9</m> years <m>9</m> months for the investment to double.

            <li>
              <p>
                To find the average rate of change of <m>A</m> from the end of the fourth year to the end of the fifth year,
                we compute <m>\frac{A(5)-A(4)}{5-4} \approx 195.63</m>.
                Similarly,
          the average rate of change of <m>A</m> from the end of the thirty-fourth year to the end of the thirty-fifth year is <m>\frac{A(35)-A(34)}{35-34} \approx 1648.21</m>.
                This means that the value of the investment is increasing at a rate of approximately
                <m>\dollar195.63</m> per year between the end of the fourth and fifth years,
                while that rate jumps to
          <m>\dollar1648.21</m> per year between the end of the thirty-fourth and thirty-fifth years.
                So, not only is it true that the longer you wait,
          the more money you have,
                but also the longer you wait,
                the faster the money increases.

                    In fact,
                the rate of increase of the amount in the account is exponential as well.
                    This is the quality that really defines exponential functions.
                    We'll have more to say about this once we reach Calculus.

      We have observed that the more times you compound the interest per year,
      the more money you will earn in a year.
      Let's push this notion to the limit.
      Consider an investment of
      <m>\dollar 1</m> invested at <m>100 \%</m> interest for <m>1</m> year compounded <m>n</m> times a year.
      <xref ref="compoundinterest">Equation</xref>
      tells us that the amount of money in the account after <m>1</m> year is <m>A = \left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^{n}</m>.
      Below is a table of values relating <m>n</m> and <m>A</m>.
      <me>
        \begin{array}{|r||r|}  

        \hline

        n \amp  A   \\ \hline
        1  \amp  2  \\  \hline
        2  \amp  2.25  \\  \hline
        4 \amp  \approx 2.4414  \\  \hline
        12 \amp  \approx 2.6130  \\  \hline

    <p>
      As promised, the more compoundings per year,
      the more money there is in the account,
      but we also observe that the increase in money is greatly diminishing.
      We are witnessing a mathematical <q>tug of war</q>.
      While we are compounding more times per year,
      and hence getting interest on our interest more often,
      the amount of time between compoundings is getting smaller and smaller,
      so there is less time to build up additional interest.
      With Calculus, we can show
      (or define, depending on your point of view)
      that as <m>n \rightarrow \infty</m>,
      <m>A = \left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^{n} \rightarrow e</m>,
      where <m>e</m> is the natural base first presented in <xref ref="IntroExpLogs">Section</xref>.
      Taking the number of compoundings per year to infinity results in what is called
      <em>continuously</em> compounded interest.

      Curiously enough,
      the same principles which govern compound interest are also used to model short term growth of populations.

          In order to complete the formula,
          we need to determine the growth rate <m>k</m>.
          We know that after one week,
          the number of cells has grown to five million.
          Since <m>t</m> measures days and the units of <m>N</m> are in thousands,
          this translates mathematically to <m>N(7) = 5000</m>.
          We get the equation <m>12e^{7k} = 5000</m> which gives <m>k = \frac{1}{7} \ln\left(\frac{1250}{3}\right)</m>.
          Hence, <m>N(t) = 12e^{ \frac{t}{7} \ln\left(\frac{1250}{3}\right)}</m>.
          Of course, in practice,
          we would approximate <m>k</m> to some desired accuracy,
          say <m>k \approx 0.8618</m>,
          which we can interpret as an
          <m>86.18 \%</m> daily growth rate for the cells.

      Whereas <xref ref="continuouscompoundinterest">Equations</xref>
      and <xref ref="lawofuninhibitedgrowth"></xref>
      model the growth of quantities,
      we can use equations like them to describe the decline of quantities.
      One example we've seen already is <xref ref="cardepreciationex">Example</xref>
      in <xref ref="IntroExpLogs">Section</xref>.
      There, the value of a car declined from its purchase price of <m>\dollar25,\!000</m> to nothing at all.
      Another real world phenomenon which follows suit is radioactive decay.
      There are elements which are unstable and emit energy spontaneously.
      In doing so, the amount of the element itself diminishes.
      The assumption behind this model is that the rate of decay of an element at a particular time is directly proportional to the amount of the element present at that time.
      In other words, the more of the element there is,
      the faster the element decays.
      This is precisely the same kind of hypothesis which drives The Law of Uninhibited Growth,
      and as such,
      the equation governing radioactive decay is hauntingly similar to <xref ref="lawofuninhibitedgrowth">Equation</xref>
      with the exception that the rate constant <m>k</m> is negative.

          Iodine-131 is a commonly used radioactive isotope used to help detect how well the thyroid is functioning.

          and that the half-life
          (the time it takes for half of the substance to decay)

          Since we start with <m>5</m> grams initially,

      We now turn our attention to some more mathematically sophisticated models.
      One such model is Newton's Law of Cooling,
      which we first encountered in <xref ref="exptempex">Example</xref>
      of <xref ref="IntroExpLogs">Section</xref>.
      In that example we had a cup of coffee cooling from <m>160^{\circ}\mbox{F}</m> to room temperature
      <m>70^{\circ}\mbox{F}</m> according to the formula <m>T(t) = 70 + 90 e^{-0.1 t}</m>,
      where <m>t</m> was measured in minutes.
      In this situation,
      we know the physical limit of the temperature of the coffee is room temperature,
      and the differential equation which gives rise to our formula for <m>T(t)</m> takes this into account.
      Whereas the radioactive decay model had a rate of decay at time <m>t</m> directly proportional to the amount of the element which remained at time <m>t</m>, Newton's Law of Cooling states that the rate of cooling of the coffee at a given time <m>t</m> is directly proportional to how much of a temperature <em>gap</em>
      exists between the coffee at time <m>t</m> and room temperature,
      not the temperature of the coffee itself.
      In other words, the coffee cools faster when it is first served,
      and as its temperature nears room temperature,
      the coffee cools ever more slowly.
      Of course, if we take an item from the refrigerator and let it sit out in the kitchen,
      the object's temperature will rise to room temperature,
      and since the physics behind warming and cooling is the same,
      we combine both cases in the equation below.
    </p>

    <aside>
      <p>
        The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that heat can spontaneously flow from a hotter object to a colder one,
        but not the other way around.
        Thus, the coffee could not continue to release heat into the air so as to cool below room temperature.

      The rate constant <m>k = 0.1</m> indicates the coffee is cooling at a rate equal to <m>10 \%</m> of the difference between the temperature of the coffee and its surroundings.
      Note in <xref ref="newtonslawofcooling">Equation</xref>

                The environment in which we are placing the roast is the
                <m>350^{\circ}\mbox{F}</m> oven, so <m>T_{a} = 350</m>.
                Newton's Law of Warming tells us <m>T(t) = 350 + (40-350)e^{-kt}</m>,

      If we had taken the time to graph <m>y=T(t)</m> in <xref ref="exptempex2">Example</xref>,
      we would have found the horizontal asymptote to be <m>y = 350</m>,
      which corresponds to the temperature of the oven.
      We can also arrive at this conclusion by applying a bit of <q>number sense</q>.
      As <m>t \rightarrow \infty</m>,
      <m>-0.1602 t \approx \mbox{very big <m>(-)</m>}</m> so that <m>e^{-0.1602 t} \approx \mbox{very small <m>(+)</m>}</m>.
      The larger the value of <m>t</m>,
      the smaller <m>e^{-0.1602 t}</m> becomes so that <m>T(t) \approx 350 -\mbox{very small <m>(+)</m>}</m>,
      which indicates the graph of <m>y=T(t)</m> is approaching its horizontal asymptote <m>y=350</m> from below.
      Physically, this means the roast will eventually warm up to
      <m>350^{\circ}\mbox{F}</m> (at which point it would be more toast than roast).
      The function <m>T</m> is sometimes called a

      <em>limited</em> growth model,
      since the function <m>T</m> remains bounded as <m>t \rightarrow \infty</m>.
      If we apply the principles behind Newton's Law of Cooling to a biological example,
      it says the growth rate of a population is directly proportional to how much room the population has to grow.
      In other words, the more room for expansion,
      the faster the growth rate.
      The <em>logistic</em> growth model combines The Law of Uninhibited Growth with limited growth and states that the rate of growth of a population varies jointly with the population itself as well as the room the population has to grow.

    <p>
      If we take the time to analyze the graph of <m>y=N(x)</m> above,
      we can see graphically how logistic growth combines features of uninhibited and limited growth.
      The curve seems to rise steeply,
      then at some point, begins to level off.
      The point at which this happens is called an
          <idx><h>inflection point</h></idx> <idx><h>point of diminishing returns</h></idx>
      <em>inflection point</em>
      or is sometimes called the <q>point of diminishing returns</q>.
      At this point, even though the function is still increasing,
      the rate at which it does so begins to decline.
      It turns out the point of diminishing returns always occurs at half the limiting population. (In our case,
      when <m>y=42</m>.) While these concepts are more precisely quantified using Calculus,
      <xref ref="fig_expapp3">Figures</xref>
      and <xref ref="fig_expapp4"></xref>
      give two views of the graph of <m>y=N(x)</m>,
      one on the interval <m>[0,8]</m>,
      the other on <m>[8,15]</m>.
      The former looks strikingly like uninhibited growth;
      the latter like limited growth.

    <title>Applications of Logarithms</title>
    <p>
      Just as many physical phenomena can be modelled by exponential functions,
      the same is true of logarithmic functions.
      In <xref ref="Richterexercise">Exercises</xref>,
      <xref ref="decibelexercise"></xref>
      and <xref ref="pHexercise"></xref>
      of <xref ref="IntroExpLogs">Section</xref>,
      we showed that logarithms are useful in measuring the intensities of earthquakes
      (the Richter scale),
      sound (decibels) and acids and bases (pH).
      We now present yet a different use of the a basic logarithm function,
      <url href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength"><em>password strength</em></url>.

          In general, the higher the entropy,

                If a <m>7</m> character case-sensitive

                find the associated information entropy.

                How many possible symbol options per character is required to produce a <m>7</m> character password with an information entropy of <m>50</m> bits?

              <p>
                There are <m>26</m> letters in the alphabet,
                <m>52</m> if upper and lower case letters are counted as different.
                There are <m>10</m> digits (<m>0</m> through <m>9</m>) for a total of <m>N=62</m> symbols.
                Since the password is to be <m>7</m> characters long,
                <m>L = 7</m>.
                Thus,
          <m>H = 7 \log_{2}(62) = \frac{7 \ln(62)}{\ln(2)} \approx 41.68</m>.

                We have <m>L = 7</m> and <m>H=50</m> and we need to find <m>N</m>.
                Solving the equation
          <m>50 = 7 \log_{2}(N)</m> gives <m>N = 2^{50/7} \approx 141.323</m>,
                so we would need <m>142</m> different symbols to choose from. (Since there are only <m>94</m> distinct ASCII keyboard characters,
                to achieve this strength,
                the number of characters in the password should be increased.)

      Chemical systems known as <url href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_solutions"><em>buffer solutions</em></url>
          <idx><h>buffer solution</h></idx>
      have the ability to adjust to small changes in acidity to maintain a range of pH values.
      Buffer solutions have a wide variety of applications from maintaining a healthy fish tank to regulating the pH levels in blood.
      Our next example shows how the pH in a buffer solution is a little more complicated than the pH we first encountered in <xref ref="pHexercise">Exercise</xref>
      in <xref ref="IntroExpLogs">Section</xref>.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="ex_bloodbuffer">
      <title>Buffer solutions</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Blood is a buffer solution.
          When carbon dioxide is absorbed into the bloodstream it produces carbonic acid and lowers the pH. The body compensates by producing bicarbonate,
          a weak base to partially neutralize the acid.
          The equation which models blood pH in this situation is <m>\mbox{pH} = 6.1 + \log\left(\frac{800}{x} \right)</m>,
          where <m>x</m> is the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood,
          measured in torr.
          Find the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood if the pH is <m>7.4</m>.
        </p>

        <aside>
          <p>
            The equation for blood pH in <xref ref="ex_bloodbuffer">Example</xref>
            is derived from the <url href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henderson-Hasselbalch_equation"><em>Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation</em></url>.
            See <xref ref="HendersonHasselbalch">Exercise</xref>
            in <xref ref="LogProperties">Section</xref>.
            Hasselbalch himself was studying carbon dioxide dissolving in blood - a process called <url href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_acidosis"><em>metabolic acidosis</em></url>.
          </p>
        </aside>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We set <m>\mbox{pH} = 7.4</m> and get <m>7.4 = 6.1 + \log\left(\frac{800}{x} \right)</m>,
          or <m>\log\left(\frac{800}{x} \right) = 1.3</m>.
          Solving, we find <m>x = \frac{800}{10^{1.3}} \approx 40.09</m>.
          Hence, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood is about <m>40</m> torr.

          if Fritzy the Fox's speed is the same as Chewbacca the Bunny's speed, Fritzy's pursuit curve is given by
          <me>
            y(x) = \frac{1}{4} x^2-\frac{1}{4} \ln(x)-\frac{1}{4}

        <p>
          Use your calculator to graph this path for <m>x > 0</m>.
          Describe the behaviour of <m>y</m> as
          <m>x \rightarrow 0^{+}</m> and interpret this physically.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          From the graph, it appears that as <m>x \rightarrow 0^{+}</m>,
          <m>y \rightarrow \infty</m>.
          This is due to the presence of the <m>\ln(x)</m> term in the function.
          This means that Fritzy will never catch Chewbacca,
          which makes sense since Chewbacca has a head start and Fritzy only runs as fast as he does.

          we stated that the cable of a suspension bridge formed a parabola but that a free hanging cable did not.
          A free hanging cable forms a <em>catenary</em>
          and its basic shape is given by <m>y = \frac{1}{2}\left(e^{x} + e^{-x}\right)</m>.
          Use your calculator to graph this function.
          What are its domain and range?
          What is its end behaviour?
          Is it invertible?
          How do you think it is related to the function given in <xref ref="hyperbolicsine">Exercise</xref> in <xref ref="ExpEquations">Section</xref>
          and the one given in the answer to <xref ref="inversehyptangent">Exercise</xref>

          When flipped upside down, the catenary makes an arch.
          The Gateway Arch in St.
