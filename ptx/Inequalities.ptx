    <p>
      In this section,
      not only do we develop techniques for solving various classes of inequalities analytically,
      we also look at them graphically.
      The first example motivates the core ideas.

              <p>
                To solve <m>f(x) = g(x)</m>,
                we replace <m>f(x)</m> with <m>2x-1</m> and <m>g(x)</m> with <m>5</m> to get <m>2x-1 = 5</m>.
                Solving for <m>x</m>, we get <m>x=3</m>.

              <p>
                The inequality <m>f(x) \lt g(x)</m> is equivalent to <m>2x-1 \lt 5</m>.
                Solving gives <m>x \lt 3</m> or <m>(-\infty, 3)</m>.

            <li>
              <p>
                To find where <m>f(x) > g(x)</m>, we solve <m>2x-1 > 5</m>.
                We get <m>x > 3</m>, or <m>(3, \infty)</m>.

                To graph <m>y=f(x)</m>, we graph <m>y = 2x-1</m>,
                which is a line with a <m>y</m>-intercept of <m>(0,-1)</m> and a slope of <m>2</m>.
                The graph of <m>y=g(x)</m> is <m>y=5</m> which is a horizontal line through <m>(0,5)</m>. <figure xml:id="fig_linearineq"> <caption>Graphical interpretation of <xref ref="ex_motineq">Example</xref></caption> <sidebyside> <figure> <caption>Intersecting graphs <m>y=f(x)</m> and <m>y=g(x)</m></caption> <img src="figures/LinearQuadraticGraphics/Inequalities-1.pdf"/> </figure> <figure> <m>f(x)\lt g(x)</m> on

                we recall the Fundamental Graphing Principle for Functions in <xref ref="GraphsofFunctions">Section</xref>:
                the point <m>(a,b)</m> is on the graph of <m>f</m> if and only if <m>f(a)=b</m>.
                In other words,
                a generic point on the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> is <m>(x,f(x))</m>,
                and a generic point on the graph of <m>y=g(x)</m> is <m>(x,g(x))</m>.
                When we seek solutions to <m>f(x)=g(x)</m>,
                we are looking for <m>x</m> values whose <m>y</m> values on the graphs of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are the same.
                In part 1, we found <m>x=3</m> is the solution to <m>f(x)=g(x)</m>.
                Sure enough, <m>f(3) = 5</m> and
                <m>g(3) = 5</m> so that the point <m>(3,5)</m> is on both graphs.
                In other words, the graphs of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>
                <em>intersect</em> at <m>(3,5)</m>.
                In part 2, we set <m>f(x) \lt g(x)</m> and solved to find <m>x \lt 3</m>.
                For <m>x \lt 3</m>, the point <m>(x,f(x))</m> is <em>below</em>
                <m>(x,g(x))</m> since the <m>y</m> values on the graph of <m>f</m> are less than the <m>y</m> values on the graph of <m>g</m> there.
                Analogously, in part 3, we solved
                <m>f(x) > g(x)</m> and found <m>x > 3</m>.
                For <m>x > 3</m>, note that the graph of <m>f</m> is
                <em>above</em> the graph of <m>g</m>,
                since the <m>y</m> values on the graph of <m>f</m> are greater than the <m>y</m> values on the graph of <m>g</m> for those values of <m>x</m>:

      As with <xref ref="absolutevalueprops">Theorem</xref>
      in <xref ref="AbsoluteValueFunctions">Section</xref>,
      we could argue <xref ref="absolutevalueineq">Theorem</xref> using cases.
      However, in light of what we have developed in this section,
      we can understand these statements graphically.
      For instance, if <m>c > 0</m>,
      the graph of <m>y=c</m> is a horizontal line which lies above the <m>x</m>-axis through <m>(0,c)</m>.
      To solve <m>|x| \lt c</m>,
      we are looking for the <m>x</m> values where the graph of <m>y=|x|</m> is below the graph of <m>y=c</m>.
      We know that the graphs intersect when <m>|x|=c</m>, which,
      from <xref ref="AbsoluteValueFunctions">Section</xref>,
      we know happens when <m>x=c</m> or <m>x=-c</m>.

    <p>
      In <xref ref="fig_absvalineq">Figure</xref>
      we see that the graph of <m>y=|x|</m> is below <m>y=c</m> for <m>x</m> between <m>-c</m> and <m>c</m>,

      The other properties in <xref ref="absolutevalueineq">Theorem</xref> can be shown similarly.

                Rewriting the compound inequality <m>2 \lt |x-1| \leq 5</m> as
                <q><m>2 \lt |x-1|</m> and <m>|x-1| \leq 5</m></q>
                allows us to solve each piece using <xref ref="absolutevalueineq">Theorem</xref>.
                The first inequality,
                <m>2 \lt |x-1|</m> can be re-written as <m>|x-1|>2</m> so <m>x-1 \lt -2</m> or <m>x-1 > 2</m>.
                We get <m>x\lt -1</m> or <m>x>3</m>.
                Our solution to the first inequality is then <m>(-\infty, -1) \cup (3, \infty)</m>.
                For <m>|x-1| \leq 5</m>,
                we combine results in <xref ref="absolutevalueprops">Theorems</xref>
                and <xref ref="absolutevalueineq"></xref>
                to get <m>-5 \leq x-1 \leq 5</m> so that <m>-4 \leq x \leq 6</m>,
                or <m>[-4,6]</m>.
                Our solution to <m>2 \lt |x-1| \leq 5</m> is comprised of values of <m>x</m> which satisfy both parts of the inequality,
                so we take the intersection of
                <m>(-\infty, -1) \cup (3, \infty)</m> and <m>[-4,6]</m> to get <m>[-4,-1) \cup (3,6]</m>.
                (see <xref ref="intersectionunion">Definition</xref>

                Graphically,
                we see that the graph of <m>y=|x-1|</m> is <q>between</q>
                the horizontal lines <m>y=2</m> and <m>y=5</m> for <m>x</m> values between <m>-4</m> and <m>-1</m> as well as those between <m>3</m> and <m>6</m>.
                Including the <m>x</m> values where <m>y=|x-1|</m> and <m>y=5</m> intersect,
                we get <xref ref="fig_absvalineqeg3">Figure</xref>. <figure xml:id="fig_absvalineqeg3"> <caption>Solving

                We need to exercise some special caution when solving <m>|x+1|\geq \frac{x+4}{2}</m>.
                As we saw in <xref ref="absvalueeqnex">Example</xref>
                in <xref ref="AbsoluteValueFunctions">Section</xref>,
                when variables are both inside and outside of the absolute value,
                it's usually best to refer to the definition of absolute value,
                <xref ref="absolutevalue">Definition</xref>,
                to remove the absolute values and proceed from there.
                To that end, we have <m>|x+1| = -(x+1)</m> if
                <m>x \lt -1</m> and <m>|x+1| = x+1</m> if <m>x \geq -1</m>.
                We break the inequality into cases,
                the first case being when <m>x\lt -1</m>.
                For these values of <m>x</m>,
                our inequality becomes <m>-(x+1) \geq \frac{x+4}{2}</m>.
                Solving, we get <m>-2x-2 \geq x+4</m>,
                so that <m>-3x \geq 6</m>,
          which means <m>x \leq -2</m>.
                Since all of these solutions fall into the category <m>x \lt -1</m>,
                we keep them all.
                For the second case, we assume <m>x \geq -1</m>.
                Our inequality becomes <m>x+1 \geq \frac{x+4}{2}</m>,
                which gives <m>2x+2 \geq x+4</m> or <m>x \geq 2</m>.
                Since all of these values of <m>x</m> are greater than or equal to <m>-1</m>,
                we accept all of these solutions as well.
                Our final answer is
          <m>(-\infty, -2] \cup [2,\infty)</m>. <figure xml:id="fig_absvalineqeg4"> <caption>Solving

      We now turn our attention to quadratic inequalities.
      In the last example of <xref ref="QuadraticFunctions">Section</xref>,
      we needed to determine the solution to <m>x^2 - x -6 \lt 0</m>.
      We will now re-visit this problem using some of the techniques developed in this section not only to reinforce our solution in <xref ref="QuadraticFunctions">Section</xref>,
      but to also help formulate a general analytic procedure for solving all quadratic inequalities.
      If we consider <m>f(x) = x^2-x-6</m> and <m>g(x)=0</m>,
      then solving <m>x^2 - x -6 \lt 0</m> corresponds graphically to finding the values of <m>x</m> for which the graph of <m>y=f(x)=x^2-x-6</m>
      (the parabola)
      is below the graph of <m>y=g(x)=0</m> (the <m>x</m>-axis).
      See <xref ref="fig_parabineq0">Figure</xref> for reference.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="fig_parabineq0">
      <caption><m>y=x^2-x-6</m></caption>
      <img src="figures/LinearQuadraticGraphics/Inequalities-12.pdf"/>
    </figure>

    <p>
      \phantomsection We can see that the graph of <m>f</m> does dip below the <m>x</m>-axis between its two <m>x</m>-intercepts.
      The zeros of <m>f</m> are <m>x=-2</m> and <m>x=3</m> in this case and they divide the domain
      (the <m>x</m>-axis)
      into three intervals:
      <m>(-\infty, -2)</m>, <m>(-2,3)</m> and <m>(3, \infty)</m>.
      For every number in <m>(-\infty, -2)</m>,
      the graph of <m>f</m> is above the <m>x</m>-axis;
      in other words,
      <m>f(x) > 0</m> for all <m>x</m> in <m>(-\infty, -2)</m>.
      Similarly, <m>f(x) \lt 0</m> for all <m>x</m> in <m>(-2,3)</m>,
      and <m>f(x) > 0</m> for all <m>x</m> in <m>(3, \infty)</m>.
      We can schematically represent this with the <em>sign diagram</em>
          <idx><h>inequality</h><h>sign diagram</h></idx><idx><h>sign diagram</h><h>for quadratic inequality</h></idx>
      below.
    </p>

    <p>
      <img src="figures/LinearQuadraticGraphics/Inequalities-13.pdf"/>
    </p>

    <p>
      Here, the <m>(+)</m> above a portion of the number line indicates
      <m>f(x) > 0</m> for those values of <m>x</m>;
      the <m>(-)</m> indicates <m>f(x) \lt 0</m> there.
      The numbers labeled on the number line are the zeros of <m>f</m>,
      so we place <m>0</m> above them.
      We see at once that the solution to <m>f(x) \lt 0</m> is <m>(-2,3)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our next goal is to establish a procedure by which we can generate the sign diagram without graphing the function.
      An important property of quadratic functions is that if the function is positive at one point and negative at another,
      the function must have at least one zero in between.
      Graphically,
      this means that a parabola can't be above the <m>x</m>-axis at one point and below the <m>x</m>-axis at another point without crossing the <m>x</m>-axis.
      This allows us to determine the sign of <em>all</em>
      of the function values on a given interval by testing the function at just
      <em>one</em> value in the interval.
      This gives us the following.

                To solve <m>2x^2 \leq 3-x</m>,
                we first get <m>0</m> on one side of the inequality which yields <m>2x^2+x-3 \leq 0</m>.
                We find the zeros of
          <m>f(x) = 2x^2 + x - 3</m> by solving <m>2x^2 + x - 3 = 0</m> for <m>x</m>.
                Factoring gives <m>(2x+3)(x-1)=0</m>,
                so <m>x = -\frac{3}{2}</m> or <m>x = 1</m>.
                We place these values on the number line with <m>0</m> above them and choose test values in the intervals <m>\left(-\infty, -\frac{3}{2}\right)</m>,
                <m>\left(-\frac{3}{2},1\right)</m> and <m>(1,\infty)</m>.
                For the interval  <m>\left(-\infty, -\frac{3}{2}\right)</m>,
                we choose <m>x=-2</m>;
                for <m>\left(-\frac{3}{2},1\right)</m>, we pick <m>x=0</m>;
                and for <m>(1,\infty)</m>, <m>x=2</m>.
                Evaluating the function at the three test values gives us <m>f(-2) = 3 > 0</m>,
                so we place <m>(+)</m> above
                <m>\left(-\infty, -\frac{3}{2}\right)</m>;  <m>f(0)=-3 \lt  0</m>,
                so <m>(-)</m> goes above the interval
                <m>\left(-\frac{3}{2},1\right)</m>;  and, <m>f(2) = 7</m>,
                which means <m>(+)</m> is placed above <m>(1,\infty)</m>.
                Since we are solving <m>2x^2+x-3 \leq 0</m>,
                we look for solutions to
          <m>2x^2+x-3 \lt  0</m> as well as solutions for <m>2x^2+x-3 =0</m>.
                For <m>2x^2+x-3 \lt  0</m>,
          we need the intervals which we have a <m>(-)</m>.
                Checking the sign diagram,
          we see this is <m>\left(-\frac{3}{2},1\right)</m>.
                We know <m>2x^2+x-3 =0</m> when <m>x=-\frac{3}{2}</m> and <m>x=1</m>,
                so our final answer is <m>\left[-\frac{3}{2},1\right]</m>.

                To verify our solution graphically,

                We let <m>g(x) = 2x^2</m> and <m>h(x)=3-x</m>.
                We are looking for the <m>x</m> values where the graph of <m>g</m> is below that of <m>h</m> (the solution to

                Once again, we re-write <m>x^2-2x > 1</m> as
                <m>x^2-2x-1>0</m> and we identify <m>f(x)=x^2-2x-1</m>.
                When we go to find the zeros of <m>f</m>, we find,
          to our chagrin,
                that the quadratic <m>x^2-2x-1</m> doesn't factor nicely.
                Hence,
          we resort to the quadratic formula to solve <m>x^2-2x-1=0</m>,
                and arrive at <m>x=1 \pm \sqrt{2}</m>.
                As before,
          these zeros divide the number line into three pieces.
                To help us decide on test values,
                we approximate <m>1 - \sqrt{2} \approx -0.4</m> and <m>1 + \sqrt{2} \approx 2.4</m>.
                We choose <m>x=-1</m>,
                <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=3</m> as our test values and find <m>f(-1)= 2</m>,

                and <m>f(3)=2</m> which is <m>(+)</m> again.
                Our solution to <m>x^2-2x-1>0</m> is where we have <m>(+)</m>, so,

                To check the inequality <m>x^2 - 2x > 1</m> graphically,
                we set <m>g(x) = x^2-2x</m> and <m>h(x)=1</m>.

                we solve <m>x^2-2x+1 \leq 0</m>.
                Setting <m>f(x) = x^2-2x+1=0</m>,
                we find the only one zero of <m>f</m>, <m>x = 1</m>.
                This one <m>x</m> value divides the number line into two intervals,

                we are looking for <m>x</m> values where
                <m>x^2-2x+1 \lt 0</m> as well as where <m>x^2-2x+1 = 0</m>.
                Looking at our sign diagram,
                there are no places where
                <m>x^2-2x+1 \lt 0</m> (there are no <m>(-)</m>),
                so our solution is only <m>x=1</m> (where <m>x^2-2x+1 = 0</m>).
                We write this as <m>\left\{1\right\}</m>.
                Graphically,
                we solve <m>x^2+1 \leq 2x</m> by graphing <m>g(x) = x^2+1</m> and <m>h(x)=2x</m>.
                We are looking for the <m>x</m> values where the graph of <m>g</m> is below the graph of <m>h</m>
                (for <m>x^2+1 \lt 2x</m>)
                and where the two graphs intersect (<m>x^2+1 = 2x</m>);
                see <xref ref="fig_quadineqeg6">Figure</xref>.
                Notice that the line and the parabola touch at <m>\left(1, 2\right)</m>,
                but the parabola is always above the line otherwise.
                In this case, we say the line <m>y=2x</m> is <em>tangent</em>
                to <m>y=x^2+1</m> at <m>\left(1, 2\right)</m>.
                Finding tangent lines to arbitrary functions is a fundamental problem solved,
                in general,
                with Calculus. <figure xml:id="fig_quadineqeg3"> <caption>The sign diagram for

            <li>
              <p>
                To solve our last inequality,
                <m>2x-x^2 \geq |x-1|-1</m>,
          we re-write the absolute value using cases.
                For <m>x \lt 1</m>, <m>|x-1| = -(x-1) = 1-x</m>,
                so we get <m>2x-x^2 \geq 1-x-1</m>, or <m>x^2-3x \leq 0</m>.
                Finding the zeros of <m>f(x) = x^2-3x</m>,
                we get <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=3</m>.
                However,
          we are only concerned with the portion of the number line where <m>x \lt 1</m>,
                so the only zero that we concern ourselves with is <m>x=0</m>.
                This divides the interval <m>x\lt 1</m> into two intervals:
                <m>(-\infty, 0)</m> and <m>(0,1)</m>.
                We choose <m>x=-1</m> and <m>x=\frac{1}{2}</m> as our test values.
                We find <m>f(-1) = 4</m> and <m>f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\frac{5}{4}</m>,
                giving us the signs in <xref ref="fig_quadineqeg7">Figure</xref>.
                Hence, our solution to
          <m>x^2-3x \leq 0</m> for <m>x \lt 1</m> is <m>[0,1)</m>.
                Next, we turn our attention to the case <m>x \geq 1</m>.
                Here, <m>|x-1| = x-1</m>,
                so our original inequality becomes
                <m>2x-x^2 \geq x-1-1</m>, or <m>x^2-x-2 \leq 0</m>.
                Setting <m>g(x) = x^2-x-2</m>,
                we find the zeros of <m>g</m> to be <m>x=-1</m> and <m>x=2</m>.
                Of these, only <m>x=2</m> lies in the region
                <m>x \geq 1</m>, so we ignore <m>x=-1</m>.
                Our test intervals are now <m>[1,2)</m> and <m>(2,\infty)</m>.
                We choose <m>x=1</m> and <m>x=3</m> as our test values and find <m>g(1) = -2</m> and <m>g(3) = 4</m>,
                yielding the sign diagram in <xref ref="fig_quadineqeg8">Figure</xref>.
                Hence, our solution to <m>g(x) = x^2-x-2 \leq 0</m>,
                in this region is <m>[1,2)</m>. <figure xml:id="fig_quadineqeg7"> <caption>The sign diagram for <m>f(x)=x^2-3x</m>,

                we have that our solution is <m>[0,2]</m>.
                Graphically, to check <m>2x-x^2 \geq |x-1|-1</m>,
                we set <m>h(x) = 2x-x^2</m> and
                <m>i(x) = |x-1|-1</m> and look for the <m>x</m> values where the graph of <m>h</m> is above the the graph of <m>i</m> (the solution of
                <m>h(x) > i(x)</m>) as well as the <m>x</m>-coordinates of the intersection points of both graphs (where <m>h(x)=i(x)</m>).
                The combined sign chart is given in <xref ref="fig_quadineqeg9">Figure</xref>
                and the graphs are plotted in <xref ref="fig_quadineqeglast">Figure</xref>.

    <p>
      One of the classic applications of inequalities is the notion of tolerances.
      Recall that for real numbers <m>x</m> and <m>c</m>,
      the quantity <m>|x-c|</m> may be interpreted as the distance from <m>x</m> to <m>c</m>.
      Solving inequalities of the form <m>|x-c| \leq d</m> for
      <m>d \geq 0</m> can then be interpreted as finding all numbers <m>x</m> which lie within <m>d</m> units of <m>c</m>.
      We can think of the number <m>d</m> as a <q>tolerance</q>
      and our solutions <m>x</m> as being within an accepted tolerance of <m>c</m>.
      We use this principle in the next example.

      <title>Computing tolerance</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The area <m>A</m>
          (in square inches)
          of a square piece of particle board which measures <m>x</m> inches on each side is <m>A(x) = x^2</m>.
          Suppose a manufacturer needs to produce a <m>24</m> inch by <m>24</m> inch square piece of particle board as part of a home office desk kit.
          How close does the side of the piece of particle board need to be cut to <m>24</m> inches to guarantee that the area of the piece is within a tolerance of <m>0.25</m> square inches of the target area of <m>576</m> square inches?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Mathematically,
          we express the desire for the area <m>A(x)</m> to be within <m>0.25</m> square inches of <m>576</m> as <m>|A - 576| \leq 0.25</m>.
          Since <m>A(x) = x^2</m>, we get <m>|x^2 - 576| \leq 0.25</m>,
          which is equivalent to <m>-0.25 \leq x^2 - 576 \leq 0.25</m>.
          One way to proceed at this point is to solve the two inequalities <m>-0.25 \leq x^2 - 576</m> and
          <m>x^2 - 576 \leq 0.25</m> individually using sign diagrams and then taking the intersection of the solution sets.
          While this way will (eventually) lead to the correct answer,
          we take this opportunity to showcase the increasing property of the square root:
          if <m>0 \leq a \leq b</m>, then <m>\sqrt{a} \leq \sqrt{b}</m>.
          To use this property, we proceed as follows
          <md>
            <mrow>-0.25  \leq \amp  x^2 - 576  \leq 0.25</mrow>
            <mrow>575.75 \leq \amp  x^2  \leq 576.25  \tag{(add $576$ across the inequalities.)}</mrow>
            <mrow>\sqrt{575.75} \leq \amp  \sqrt{x^2}  \leq \sqrt{576.25}  \tag{(take square roots.)}</mrow>
            <mrow>\sqrt{575.75} \leq \amp  |x|  \leq \sqrt{576.25}  \tag{($\sqrt{x^2} = |x|$)}</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>

        <p>
          By <xref ref="absolutevalueineq">Theorem</xref>,
          we find the solution to <m>\sqrt{575.75} \leq |x|</m> to be
          <me>
            \left(-\infty, -\sqrt{575.75} \, \right] \cup \left[\sqrt{575.75}, \infty \right)
          </me>
          and the solution to <m>|x| \leq \sqrt{576.25}</m> to be <m>\left[-\sqrt{576.25}, \sqrt{576.25} \, \right]</m>.
          To solve <m>\sqrt{575.75} \leq  |x|  \leq \sqrt{576.25}</m>,
          we intersect these two sets to get
          <me>
            [-\sqrt{576.25}, -\sqrt{575.75}] \cup [\sqrt{575.75},\sqrt{576.25}]
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since <m>x</m> represents a length,
          we discard the negative answers and get the interval <m>[\sqrt{575.75},\sqrt{576.25}]</m>.
          This means that the side of the piece of particle board must be cut between
          <m>\sqrt{575.75} \approx 23.995</m> and <m>\sqrt{576.25} \approx 24.005</m> inches,
          a tolerance of (approximately) <m>0.005</m> inches of the target length of <m>24</m> inches.

                If we graph <m>y=|x|</m>,
                then we want all of the points in the plane
                <em>above</em> the points on the graph.
                Dotting the graph of <m>y=|x|</m> as we have done before to indicate that the points on the graph itself are not in the relation,
                we get the shaded region in <xref ref="fig_ineqrel1">Figure</xref>.

                its <m>y</m>-coordinate must be less than or equal to the <m>y</m>-coordinate on the parabola <m>y=2-x^2</m>.
                This is the set of all points <em>below</em>
                or <em>on</em> the parabola <m>y=2-x^2</m>:

              <p>
                Finally,
          the relation <m>T</m> takes the points whose <m>y</m>-coordinates satisfy both the conditions given in <m>R</m> and those of <m>S</m>.
                Thus we shade the region between <m>y=|x|</m> and <m>y=2-x^2</m>,
                keeping those points on the parabola,
                but not the points on <m>y=|x|</m>.
                To get an accurate graph,
                we need to find where these two graphs intersect,
                so we set <m>|x| = 2-x^2</m>.
                Proceeding as before,
                breaking this equation into cases, we get <m>x=-1,1</m>.

        <p>
          <m>T(t) > 42</m> on <m>(8-2\sqrt{11}, 8+2\sqrt{11}) \approx (1.37, 14.63)</m>,
          which corresponds to between 7:22 AM (1.37 hours after 6 AM) to 8:38 PM (14.63 hours after 6 AM.) However,
          since the model is valid only for <m>t</m>, <m>0 \leq t \leq 12</m>,

          The surface area <m>S</m> of a cube with edge length <m>x</m> is given by <m>S(x) = 6x^{2}</m> for <m>x > 0</m>.
          Suppose the cubes your company manufactures are supposed to have a surface area of exactly 42 square centimetres,
          but the machines you own are old and cannot always make a cube with the precise surface area desired.
          Write an inequality using absolute value that says the surface area of a given cube is no more than 3 square centimetres away
          (high or low)
          from the target of 42 square centimetres.
          Solve the inequality and write your answer using interval notation.
