    <p>
      If we add, subtract or multiply polynomial functions according to the function arithmetic rules defined in <xref ref="FunctionArithmetic">Section</xref>,
      we will produce another polynomial function.
      If, on the other hand, we divide two polynomial functions,
      the result may not be a polynomial.
      In this chapter we study
          <idx><h>rational functions</h></idx>
      <em>rational functions</em>
      - functions which are ratios of polynomials.

      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>rational function</term>
          is a function which is the ratio of polynomial functions.
          Said differently,
          <m>r</m> is a rational function if it is of the form

      <p>
        According to <xref ref="rationalfunction">Definition</xref>,
        all polynomial functions are also rational functions,
        since we can take <m>q(x)=1</m>.
      </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      As we recall from <xref ref="FunctionNotation">Section</xref>,
      we have domain issues any time the denominator of a fraction is zero.
      In the example below,
      we review this concept as well as some of the arithmetic of rational expressions.

            <li>
              <p>
                To find the domain of <m>f</m>,
                we proceed as we did in <xref ref="FunctionNotation">Section</xref>:
                we find the zeros of the denominator and exclude them from the domain.
                Setting <m>x+1=0</m> results in <m>x=-1</m>.
                Hence,
          our domain is <m>(-\infty, -1) \cup (-1,\infty)</m>.
                The expression <m>f(x)</m> is already in the form requested and when we check for common factors among the numerator and denominator we find none,
                so we are done.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Proceeding as before,
                we determine the domain of <m>g</m> by solving <m>x+1=0</m>.
                As before,
          we find the domain of <m>g</m> is <m>(-\infty, -1) \cup (-1,\infty)</m>.
                To write <m>g(x)</m> in the form requested,
                we need to get a common denominator
                <me>
                  \begin{array}{rclclcl}
                  g(x) \amp  = \amp  2 - \dfrac{3}{x+1} \amp  = \amp  \dfrac{2}{1} - \dfrac{3}{x+1} \amp  = \amp  \dfrac{(2)(x+1)}{(1)(x+1)} - \dfrac{3}{x+1} \\ [.15in]
                  \amp  = \amp  \dfrac{(2x+2) - 3}{x+1} \amp  = \amp  \dfrac{2x-1}{x+1} \amp  \amp 
                  \end{array}
                </me>
                This formula is now completely simplified.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                The denominators in the formula for <m>h(x)</m> are both <m>x^2-1</m> whose zeros are  <m>x = \pm 1</m>.
                As a result,
                the domain of <m>h</m> is <m>(-\infty, -1) \cup (-1,1) \cup (1, \infty)</m>.
                We now proceed to simplify <m>h(x)</m>.
                Since we have the same denominator in both terms,
                we subtract the numerators.
                We then factor the resulting numerator and denominator,
                and cancel out the common factor.
                <me>
                  \begin{array}{rclcl}

                  h(x) \amp  = \amp  \dfrac{2x^2-1}{x^2-1} - \dfrac{3x-2}{x^2-1} \amp  = \amp  \dfrac{\left(2x^2-1\right) - \left(3x-2\right)}{x^2-1} \\ [.15in]
                  \amp  = \amp  \dfrac{2x^2-1 - 3x+2}{x^2-1} \amp  = \amp   \dfrac{2x^2 - 3x+1}{x^2-1} \\ [.15in]
                  \amp  = \amp  \dfrac{(2x-1)(x-1)}{(x+1)(x-1)} \amp  = \amp  \dfrac{(2x-1)\cancel{(x-1)}}{(x+1)\cancel{(x-1)}} \\ [.15in]
                  \amp  = \amp  \dfrac{2x-1}{x+1} \amp  \amp

              <p>
                To find the domain of <m>r</m>,
                it may help to temporarily rewrite <m>r(x)</m> as
                <me>
                  r(x) = \dfrac{\dfrac{2x^2-1}{x^2-1} }{\dfrac{3x-2}{x^2-1}}
                </me>
                We need to set all of the denominators equal to zero which means we need to solve not only  <m>x^2-1= 0</m>,
                but also <m>\dfrac{3x-2}{x^2-1}=0</m>.
                We find <m>x = \pm 1</m> for the former and <m>x= \frac{2}{3}</m> for the latter.
                Our domain is <m>(-\infty, -1) \cup \left(-1,\frac{2}{3}\right) \cup \left(\frac{2}{3},1\right) \cup (1, \infty)</m>.
                We simplify <m>r(x)</m> by rewriting the division as multiplication by the reciprocal and then by cancelling the common factor
                <me>
                  \begin{array}{rclcl}

                  r(x) \amp  = \amp  \dfrac{2x^2-1}{x^2-1} \div \dfrac{3x-2}{x^2-1} \amp  = \amp  \dfrac{2x^2-1}{x^2-1} \cdot \dfrac{x^2-1}{3x-2}\\[.15in]
                  \amp  = \amp  \dfrac{\left(2x^2-1\right)\left(x^2-1\right)}{\left(x^2-1\right)(3x-2)} \amp  = \amp  \dfrac{\left(2x^2-1\right)\cancel{\left(x^2-1\right)}}{\cancel{\left(x^2-1\right)}(3x-2)}\\[.15in]
                  \amp  = \amp  \dfrac{2x^2-1}{3x-2}   \amp  \amp 
                  \end{array}

              </p>
            </li>

    <p>
      A few remarks about <xref ref="ratfuncex">Example</xref> are in order.
      Note that the expressions for <m>f(x)</m>,
      <m>g(x)</m> and <m>h(x)</m> work out to be the same.
      However, only two of these functions are actually equal.
      Recall that functions are ultimately sets of ordered pairs
      (you should review <xref ref="Relations">Sections</xref>
      and <xref ref="IntrotoFunctions"></xref>
      if this statement caught you off guard),
      so for two functions to be equal,
      they need, among other things, to have the same domain.
      Since <m>f(x) = g(x)</m> and <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> have the same domain,
      they are equal functions.
      Even though the formula <m>h(x)</m> is the same as <m>f(x)</m>,
      the domain of <m>h</m> is different than the domain of <m>f</m>,
      and thus they are different functions.
    </p>

    <p>
      We now turn our attention to the graphs of rational functions.
      Consider the function <m>f(x) = \dfrac{2x-1}{x+1}</m> from <xref ref="ratfuncex">Example</xref>.
      Using GeoGebra calculator,
      we obtain the graph in <xref ref="fig_ratgr1">Figure</xref>
    </p>

    <p>
      Two behaviours of the graph are worthy of further discussion.
      First, note that the graph appears to
      <q>break</q> at <m>x=-1</m>.
      We know from our last example that <m>x=-1</m> is not in the domain of <m>f</m> which means <m>f(-1)</m> is undefined.
      When we make a table of values to study the behaviour of <m>f</m> <em>near</em>
      <m>x=-1</m> we see that we can get <q>near</q>
      <m>x=-1</m> from two directions.
      We can choose values a little less than <m>-1</m>,
      for example <m>x=-1.1</m>, <m>x=-1.01</m>,
      <m>x=-1.001</m>, and so on.
      These values are said to <q>approach <m>-1</m> from the <em>left</em>.</q>
      Similarly, the values <m>x=-0.9</m>,
      <m>x=-0.99</m>, <m>x=-0.999</m>,
      etc., are said to <q>approach <m>-1</m> from the <em>right</em>.</q>
      If we make the two tables in <xref ref="fig_rattab1">Figure</xref>,
      we find that the numerical results confirm what we see graphically.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the <m>x</m> values approach <m>-1</m> from the left,
      the function values become larger and larger positive numbers. (We would need Calculus to confirm this analytically.) We express this symbolically by stating as <m>x \rightarrow -1^{-}</m>,
      <m>f(x) \rightarrow \infty</m>.
      Similarly, using analogous notation,
      we conclude from the table that as <m>x \rightarrow -1^{+}</m>,
      <m>f(x) \rightarrow -\infty</m>.
      For this type of unbounded behaviour,
      we say the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> has a
          <idx><h>asymptote</h><h>vertical ! intuitive definition of</h></idx><idx><h>vertical asymptote</h><h>intuitive definition of</h></idx>
      <em>vertical asymptote</em> of <m>x = -1</m>.
      Roughly speaking, this means that near <m>x=-1</m>,
      the graph looks very much like the vertical line <m>x=-1</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The other feature worthy of note about the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> is that it seems to <q>level off</q>
      on the left and right hand sides of the screen.
      This is a statement about the end behaviour of the function.
      As we discussed in <xref ref="GraphsofPolynomials">Section</xref>,
      the end behaviour of a function is its behaviour as <m>x</m> attains larger and larger negative values without bound (here,
      the word <q>larger</q> means larger in absolute value),
      <m>x \rightarrow -\infty</m>,
      and as <m>x</m> becomes large without bound,
      <m>x \rightarrow \infty</m>.

      From the tables in <xref ref="fig_rattab2">Figure</xref>,
      we see that as <m>x \rightarrow -\infty</m>,
      <m>f(x) \rightarrow 2^{+}</m> and as <m>x \rightarrow \infty</m>,
      <m>f(x) \rightarrow 2^{-}</m>.
      Here the <q><m>+</m></q> means <q>from above</q>
      and the <q><m>-</m></q> means <q>from below</q>.
      In this case, we say the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> has a
          <idx><h>asymptote</h><h>horizontal ! intuitive definition of</h></idx><idx><h>horizontal asymptote</h><h>intuitive definition of</h></idx>
      <em>horizontal asymptote</em> of <m>y=2</m>.
      This means that the end behaviour of <m>f</m> resembles the horizontal line <m>y=2</m>,
      which explains the <q>levelling off</q>
      behaviour we see in <xref ref="fig_ratgr1">Figure</xref>.
      We formalize the concepts of vertical and horizontal asymptotes in the following definitions.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="va">
      <title>Vertical Asymptote</title>

          either <m>f(x) \rightarrow \infty</m> or <m>f(x) \rightarrow -\infty</m>.
        </p>

    <definition xml:id="ha">

      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      Note that in <xref ref="ha">Definition</xref>,
      we write <m>f(x) \rightarrow c</m> (not <m>f(x) \rightarrow c^{+}</m> or
      <m>f(x) \rightarrow c^{-}</m>) because we are unconcerned from which direction the values <m>f(x)</m> approach the value <m>c</m>,
      just as long as they do so.
    </p>

    <aside>
      <p>
        As we shall see in the next section,
        the graphs of rational functions may,
        in fact, <em>cross</em> their horizontal asymptotes.
        If this happens, however, it does so only a
        <em>finite</em> number of times,
        and so for each choice of
        <m>x \rightarrow -\infty</m> and <m>x \rightarrow \infty</m>,
        <m>f(x)</m> will approach <m>c</m> from either below (in the case <m>f(x) \rightarrow c^{-}</m>) or above (in the case <m>f(x) \rightarrow c^{+}</m>.) We leave
        <m>f(x) \rightarrow c</m> generic in our definition, however,
        to allow this concept to apply to less tame specimens in the Precalculus zoo,
        such as <xref ref="exploregraphslast">Exercise</xref>
        in <xref ref="TrigGraphs">Section</xref>.
      </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      In our discussion following <xref ref="ratfuncex">Example</xref>,
      we determined that,
      despite the fact that the formula for <m>h(x)</m> reduced to the same formula as <m>f(x)</m>,
      the functions <m>f</m> and <m>h</m> are different,
      since <m>x=1</m> is in the domain of <m>f</m>,
      but <m>x=1</m> is not in the domain of <m>h</m>.
      If we graph <m>h(x)=\dfrac{2x^2-1}{x^2-1} - \dfrac{3x-2}{x^2-1}</m> using a graphing calculator,
      we are surprised to find that the graph looks identical to the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m>.
      There is a vertical asymptote at <m>x=-1</m>,
      but near <m>x=1</m>, everything seem fine.
      Tables of values provide numerical evidence which supports the graphical observation:

      We see that as <m>x \rightarrow 1^{-}</m>,
      <m>h(x) \rightarrow 0.5^{-}</m> and as <m>x \rightarrow 1^{+}</m>,
      <m>h(x) \rightarrow 0.5^{+}</m>.
      In other words,
      the points on the graph of <m>y=h(x)</m> are approaching <m>(1,0.5)</m>,
      but since <m>x=1</m> is not in the domain of <m>h</m>,
      it would be inaccurate to fill in a point at <m>(1,0.5)</m>.
      As we've done in past sections when something like this occurs
      (for instance,
      graphing piecewise defined functions in <xref ref="GraphsofFunctions">Section</xref>),
      we put an open circle
      (also called a <em>hole</em>
          <idx><h>hole</h><h>in a graph</h></idx><idx><h>graph</h><h>hole in</h></idx>
      in this case)
      at <m>(1,0.5)</m>.
      <xref ref="fig_ratgr3">Figure</xref>
      is a detailed graph of <m>y=h(x)</m>,
      with the vertical and horizontal asymptotes as dashed lines.

    <p>
      Neither <m>x=-1</m> nor <m>x=1</m> are in the domain of <m>h</m>,
      yet the behaviour of the graph of <m>y=h(x)</m> is drastically different near these <m>x</m>-values.
      The reason for this lies in the second to last step when we simplified the formula for <m>h(x)</m> in <xref ref="ratfuncex">Example</xref>,
      where we had <m>h(x) = \dfrac{(2x-1)(x-1)}{(x+1)(x-1)}</m>.
      The reason <m>x=-1</m> is not in the domain of <m>h</m> is because the factor <m>(x+1)</m> appears in the denominator of <m>h(x)</m>;
      similarly, <m>x=1</m> is not in the domain of <m>h</m> because of the factor <m>(x-1)</m> in the denominator of <m>h(x)</m>.
      The major difference between these two factors is that <m>(x-1)</m> cancels with a factor in the numerator whereas <m>(x+1)</m> does not.
      Loosely speaking,
      the trouble caused by <m>(x-1)</m> in the denominator is cancelled away while the factor <m>(x+1)</m> remains to cause mischief.
      This is why the graph of <m>y=h(x)</m> has a vertical asymptote at <m>x=-1</m> but only a hole at <m>x=1</m>.
      These observations are generalized and summarized in the theorem below,
      whose proof is found in Calculus.

                To use <xref ref="vavshole">Theorem</xref>,
                we first find all of the real numbers which aren't in the domain of <m>f</m>.
                To do so,
          we solve <m>x^2 - 3 = 0</m> and get <m>x = \pm \sqrt{3}</m>.
                Since the expression <m>f(x)</m> is in lowest terms,
                there is no cancellation possible,
                and we conclude that the lines <m>x = -\sqrt{3}</m> and
                <m>x=\sqrt{3}</m> are vertical asymptotes to the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m>.
                Plotting the function in GeoGebra verifies this claim,
                and from the graph in <xref ref="fig_ratgr4">Figure</xref>,
                we see that as <m>x \rightarrow -\sqrt{3}^{\, -}</m>,
                <m>f(x) \rightarrow -\infty</m>,
                as <m>x\rightarrow -\sqrt{3}^{\, +}</m>,
                <m>f(x) \rightarrow \infty</m>,
                as <m>x \rightarrow \sqrt{3}^{\, -}</m>,
                <m>f(x) \rightarrow -\infty</m>,
                and finally as <m>x\rightarrow \sqrt{3}^{\, +}</m>,
                <m>f(x) \rightarrow \infty</m>. <figure xml:id="fig_ratgr4"> <caption>The graph <m>y=f(x)</m> in <xref ref="vavsholeexample">Example</xref></caption> <image source="figures/RationalsGraphics/Rationals02"></image> </figure>

            <li>
              <p>
                Solving <m>x^2 - 9 = 0</m> gives <m>x = \pm 3</m>.
                In lowest terms <m>g(x) = \dfrac{x^2-x-6}{x^2-9} = \dfrac{(x-3)(x+2)}{(x-3)(x+3)} = \dfrac{x+2}{x+3}</m>.
                Since <m>x=-3</m> continues to make trouble in the denominator,
                we know the line <m>x=-3</m> is a vertical asymptote of the graph of <m>y=g(x)</m>.
                Since <m>x=3</m> no longer produces a <m>0</m> in the denominator,
                we have a hole at <m>x=3</m>.
                To find the <m>y</m>-coordinate of the hole,
                we substitute <m>x=3</m> into
                <m>\dfrac{x+2}{x+3}</m> and find the hole is at <m>\left(3, \frac{5}{6}\right)</m>.
                When we graph <m>y=g(x)</m> using GeoGebra,
                we clearly see the vertical asymptote at <m>x=-3</m>,
                but everything seems calm near <m>x=3</m>:
                see <xref ref="fig_ratgr5">Figure</xref>.
                Hence, as <m>x \rightarrow -3^{-}</m>,
                <m>g(x) \rightarrow \infty</m>,
                as <m>x \rightarrow -3^{+}</m>,
                <m>g(x) \rightarrow -\infty</m>,
                as <m>x \rightarrow 3^{-}</m>,
                <m>g(x) \rightarrow \frac{5}{6}^{-}</m>,
                and as <m>x \rightarrow 3^{+}</m>,
                <m>g(x) \rightarrow \frac{5}{6}^{+}</m>. <figure xml:id="fig_ratgr5"> <caption>The graph <m>y=g(x)</m> in <xref ref="vavsholeexample">Example</xref></caption> <image source="figures/RationalsGraphics/Rationals03"></image> </figure>

                The domain of <m>h</m> is all real numbers,
                since <m>x^2+9 = 0</m> has no real solutions.
                Accordingly,
                the graph of <m>y=h(x)</m> is devoid of both vertical asymptotes and holes,
                as see in <xref ref="fig_ratgr6">Figure</xref>. <figure xml:id="fig_ratgr6"> <caption>The graph <m>y=g(x)</m> in <xref ref="vavsholeexample">Example</xref></caption> <image source="figures/RationalsGraphics/Rationals04"></image> </figure>

                Setting <m>x^2+4x+4 = 0</m> gives us <m>x=-2</m> as the only real number of concern.
                Simplifying,
                we see <m>r(x) = \dfrac{x^2-x-6}{x^2+4x+4} = \dfrac{(x-3)(x+2)}{(x+2)^2} = \dfrac{x-3}{x+2}</m>.
                Since <m>x=-2</m> continues to produce a <m>0</m> in the denominator of the reduced function,
                we know <m>x=-2</m> is a vertical asymptote to the graph.
                The graph in <xref ref="fig_ratgr7">Figure</xref>
                bears this out, and, moreover,
                we see that as <m>x\rightarrow -2^{-}</m>,
                <m>r(x) \rightarrow \infty</m> and as <m>x \rightarrow -2^{+}</m>,
                <m>r(x) \rightarrow -\infty</m>. <figure xml:id="fig_ratgr7"> <caption>The graph <m>y=r(x)</m> in <xref ref="vavsholeexample">Example</xref></caption> <image source="figures/RationalsGraphics/Rationals05"></image> </figure>

                In other words,
                <m>100,\! 000</m> bacteria corresponds to <m>P(t) = 100</m>.
                Substituting for <m>P(t)</m> gives the equation <m>\dfrac{100}{(5-t)^2} = 100</m>.
                Clearing denominators and dividing by <m>100</m> gives <m>(5-t)^2=1</m>, which,
                after extracting square roots,

                Of these two solutions,

    </theorem>

    <p>
      Like <xref ref="vavshole">Theorem</xref>,
      <xref ref="hathm">Theorem</xref> is proved using Calculus.
      Nevertheless,
      we can understand the idea behind it using our example <m>f(x) = \dfrac{2x-1}{x+1}</m>.
      If we interpret <m>f(x)</m> as a division problem, <m>(2x-1) \div (x+1)</m>,
      we find that the quotient is <m>2</m> with a remainder of <m>-3</m>.
      Using what we know about polynomial division,
      specifically <xref ref="polydiv">Theorem</xref>,
      we get <m>2x-1 = 2(x+1) -3</m>.
      Dividing both sides by <m>(x+1)</m> gives
      <m>\dfrac{2x-1}{x+1} = 2 - \dfrac{3}{x+1}</m>. (You may remember this as the formula for <m>g(x)</m> in <xref ref="ratfuncex">Example</xref>.) As <m>x</m> becomes unbounded in either direction,
      the quantity <m>\dfrac{3}{x+1}</m> gets closer and closer to <m>0</m> so that the values of <m>f(x)</m> become closer and closer
      (as seen in the tables in <xref ref="fig_rattab2">Figure</xref>)
      to <m>2</m>.
      In symbols, as <m>x \rightarrow \pm \infty</m>,
      <m>f(x) \rightarrow 2</m>, and we have the result.
    </p>

    <aside>
      <p>
        More specifically, as <m>x \rightarrow -\infty</m>,
        <m>f(x) \rightarrow 2^{+}</m>,
        and as <m>x \rightarrow \infty</m>,
        <m>f(x) \rightarrow 2^{-}</m>.
        Notice that the graph gets close to the same <m>y</m> value as
        <m>x \rightarrow -\infty</m> or <m>x \rightarrow \infty</m>.
        This means that the graph can have only <em>one</em>
        horizontal asymptote if it is going to have one at all.
        Thus we were justified in using
        <q>the</q> in the previous theorem.
      </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      Alternatively,
      we can use what we know about end behaviour of polynomials to help us understand this theorem.
      From <xref ref="EBPolynomials">Theorem</xref>,
      we know the end behaviour of a polynomial is determined by its leading term.
      Applying this to the numerator and denominator of <m>f(x)</m>,
      we get that as <m>x \rightarrow \pm \infty</m>,
      <m>f(x) = \dfrac{2x-1}{x+1} \approx \dfrac{2x}{x} = 2</m>.
      This last approach is useful in Calculus, and, indeed,
      is made rigorous there. (Keep this in mind for the remainder of this paragraph.) Applying this reasoning to the general case,
      suppose <m>r(x) = \dfrac{p(x)}{q(x)}</m> where <m>a</m> is the leading coefficient of <m>p(x)</m> and <m>b</m> is the leading coefficient of <m>q(x)</m>.
      As <m>x \rightarrow \pm \infty</m>,
      <m>r(x) \approx \dfrac{ax^n}{bx^m}</m>,
      where <m>n</m> and <m>m</m> are the degrees of <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m>,
      respectively.
      If the degree of <m>p(x)</m> and the degree of <m>q(x)</m> are the same,
      then <m>n=m</m> so that <m>r(x) \approx \frac{a}{b}</m>,
      which means <m>y=\frac{a}{b}</m> is the horizontal asymptote in this case.
      If the degree of <m>p(x)</m> is less than the degree of <m>q(x)</m>,
      then <m>n \lt m</m>, so <m>m-n</m> is a positive number,
      and hence,
      <m>r(x) \approx \dfrac{a}{bx^{m-n}} \rightarrow 0</m> as <m>x \rightarrow \pm \infty</m>.
      If the degree of <m>p(x)</m> is greater than the degree of <m>q(x)</m>,
      then <m>n > m</m>,
      and hence <m>n-m</m> is a positive number and <m>r(x) \approx \dfrac{ax^{n-m}}{ b}</m>,
      which becomes unbounded as <m>x \rightarrow \pm \infty</m>.
      As we said before, if a rational function has a horizontal asymptote,
      then it will have only one. (This is not true for other types of functions we shall see in later chapters.)

      We close this section with a discussion of the <em>third</em>
      (and final!)
      kind of asymptote which can be associated with the graphs of rational functions.
      Let us return to the function
      <m>g(x) = \dfrac{x^2-4}{x+1}</m> in <xref ref="haexample">Example</xref>.
      Performing long division,
      (see the remarks following <xref ref="hathm">Theorem</xref>)
      we get <m>g(x) = \dfrac{x^2-4}{x+1} = x-1 - \dfrac{3}{x+1}</m>.
      Since the term <m>\dfrac{3}{x+1} \rightarrow 0</m> as <m>x \rightarrow \pm \infty</m>,
      it stands to reason that as <m>x</m> becomes unbounded,
      the function values <m>g(x) = x-1 - \dfrac{3}{x+1} \approx x-1</m>.
      Geometrically,
      this means that the graph of <m>y=g(x)</m> should resemble the line <m>y = x-1</m> as <m>x \rightarrow \pm \infty</m>.
      We see this play out both numerically and graphically in <xref ref="fig_slantas1">Figures</xref>
      and <xref ref="fig_slantas2"></xref>.

      A few remarks are in order.
      First, note that the stipulation
      <m>m \neq 0</m> in <xref ref="sa">Definition</xref>
      is what makes the <q>slant</q> asymptote <q>slanted</q>
      as opposed to the case when <m>m=0</m> in which case we'd have a horizontal asymptote.
      Secondly, while we have motivated what me mean intuitively by the notation
      <q><m>f(x) \rightarrow mx+b</m>,</q>
      like so many ideas in this section,
      the formal definition requires Calculus.
      Another way to express this sentiment, however,
      is to rephrase <q><m>f(x) \rightarrow mx+b</m></q>
      as <q><m>f(x) - (mx+b) \rightarrow 0</m>.</q> In other words,
      the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> has the <em>slant</em>
      asymptote <m>y = mx+b</m> if and only if the graph of <m>y = f(x) - (mx+b)</m> has a
      <em>horizontal</em> asymptote <m>y=0</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our next task is to determine the conditions under which the graph of a rational function has a slant asymptote,
      and if it does, how to find it.
      In the case of <m>g(x) = \dfrac{x^2-4}{x+1}</m>,
      the degree of the numerator <m>x^2-4</m> is <m>2</m>,
      which is <em>exactly one more</em>
      than the degree if its denominator <m>x+1</m> which is <m>1</m>.
      This results in a <em>linear</em> quotient polynomial,
      and it is this quotient polynomial which is the slant asymptote.
      Generalizing this situation gives us the following theorem. (Once again,
      this theorem is brought to you courtesy of <xref ref="polydiv">Theorem</xref> and Calculus.)
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="sathm">
      <title>Determination of Slant Asymptotes</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose <m>r</m> is a rational function and <m>r(x) = \dfrac{p(x)}{q(x)}</m>,
          where the degree of <m>p</m> is <em>exactly</em>
          one more than the degree of <m>q</m>.
          Then the graph of <m>y=r(x)</m> has
              <idx><h>asymptote</h><h>slant ! determination of</h></idx><idx><h>slant asymptote</h><h>determination of</h></idx>
          the slant asymptote <m>y=L(x)</m> where <m>L(x)</m> is the quotient obtained by dividing <m>p(x)</m> by <m>q(x)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      In the same way that <xref ref="hathm">Theorem</xref>
      gives us an easy way to see if the graph of a rational function
      <m>r(x) = \dfrac{p(x)}{q(x)}</m> has a horizontal asymptote by comparing the degrees of the numerator and denominator,
      <xref ref="sathm">Theorem</xref>
      gives us an easy way to check for slant asymptotes.
      Unlike <xref ref="hathm">Theorem</xref>,
      which gives us a quick way to <em>find</em> the horizontal asymptotes
      (if any exist),
      <xref ref="sathm">Theorem</xref>
      gives us no such <q>short-cut</q>.
      If a slant asymptote exists,
      we have no recourse but to use long division to find it. (That's OK, though.
      In the next section,
      we'll use long division to analyze end behaviour and it's worth the effort!)

      <title>Finding slant asymptotes</title>

            <li>
              <p>
                The degree of the numerator is <m>2</m> and the degree of the denominator is <m>1</m>,
                so <xref ref="sathm">Theorem</xref>
                guarantees us a slant asymptote.
                To find it, we divide <m>1-x = -x+1</m> into
                <m>x^2-4x+2</m> and get a quotient of <m>-x+3</m>,
                so our slant asymptote is <m>y=-x+3</m>.
                We confirm this graphically in <xref ref="fig_ratgr9">Figure</xref>,
                and we see that as <m>x \rightarrow -\infty</m>,
                the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> approaches the asymptote from below,
                and as <m>x \rightarrow \infty</m>,
                the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> approaches the asymptote from above.

                    Note that we are purposefully avoiding notation like `as <m>x\rightarrow \infty</m>,
                    <m>f(x) \rightarrow (-x+3)^{+}</m>.
                    While it is possible to define these notions formally with Calculus,
                    it is not standard to do so.
                    Besides, with the introduction of the symbol
                    <q>\textinterrobang</q> in the next section,
                    the authors feel we are in enough trouble already.

            <li>
              <p>
                As with the previous example,
                the degree of the numerator
                <m>g(x) = \dfrac{x^2-4}{x-2}</m> is <m>2</m> and the degree of the denominator is <m>1</m>,
                so <xref ref="sathm">Theorem</xref> applies.
                In this case,
                <me>
                  g(x) = \dfrac{x^2-4}{x-2} = \dfrac{(x+2)(x-2)}{(x-2)} = \dfrac{(x+2) \cancel{(x-2)}}{\cancelto{1}{(x-2)}} = x+2,  x \neq 2
                </me>
                so we have that the slant asymptote <m>y=x+2</m> is identical to the graph of <m>y=g(x)</m> except at <m>x=2</m> (where the latter has a
                <q>hole</q> at <m>(2,4)</m>.)  The graph
                (using GeoGebra)
                in <xref ref="fig_ratgr10">Figure</xref> supports this claim.

                    While the word <q>asymptote</q>
                    has the connotation of
          <q>approaching but not equalling,</q>
                    <xref ref="ha">Definitions</xref> and <xref ref="sa"></xref>

              <p>
                For <m>h(x) = \dfrac{x^3+1}{x^2-4}</m>,
                the degree of the numerator is <m>3</m> and the degree of the denominator is <m>2</m> so again,
                we are guaranteed the existence of a slant asymptote.
                The long division <m>\left(x^3+1 \right) \div \left(x^2-4\right)</m> gives a quotient of just <m>x</m>,
                so our slant asymptote is the line <m>y=x</m>.
                The graph confirms this,
          and we find that as <m>x \rightarrow -\infty</m>,
                the graph of <m>y=h(x)</m> approaches the asymptote from below,
                and as <m>x \rightarrow \infty</m>,

              <m>C(25) = 590</m> means it costs <dollar />590 to remove 25<percent /> of the fish and and

          <li>
            <p>
              The vertical asymptote at <m>x = 100</m> means that as we try to remove 100<percent /> of the fish from the pond,
              the cost increases without bound;
              i.e., it's impossible to remove all of the fish.

              <m>\overline{C}(x) = \frac{100x+2000}{x}</m>, <m>x > 0</m>.

              <m>\overline{C}(1) = 2100</m> and <m>\overline{C}(100) = 120</m>.
              When just <m>1</m> dOpi is produced,
              the cost per dOpi is <m>\dollar2100</m>,
              but when <m>100</m> dOpis are produced,
              the cost per dOpi is <m>\dollar120</m>.
            </p>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\overline{C}(x) = 200</m> when <m>x = 20</m>.
              So to get the cost per dOpi to <m>\dollar200</m>,
              <m>20</m> dOpis need to be produced.

          <li>

              As <m>x \rightarrow 0^{+}</m>,
              <m>\overline{C}(x) \rightarrow \infty</m>.
              This means that as fewer and fewer dOpis are produced,
              the cost per dOpi becomes unbounded.
              In this situation, there is a fixed cost of
              <m>\dollar2000</m> (<m>C(0) = 2000</m>),
              we are trying to spread that
              <m>\dollar2000</m> over fewer and fewer dOpis.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              As <m>x \rightarrow \infty</m>,
              <m>\overline{C}(x) \rightarrow 100^{+}</m>.
              This means that as more and more dOpis are produced,
              the cost per dOpi approaches <m>\dollar100</m>,
              but is always a little more than <m>\dollar100</m>.
              Since <m>\dollar100</m> is the variable cost per dOpi (<m>C(x) = \underline{100}x+2000</m>),
              it means that no matter how many dOpis are produced,
              the average cost per dOpi will always be a bit higher than the variable cost to produce a dOpi.
              As before, we can attribute this to the <m>\dollar2000</m> fixed cost,
              which factors into the average cost per dOpi no matter how many dOpis are produced.
