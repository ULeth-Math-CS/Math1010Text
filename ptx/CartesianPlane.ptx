  <title>The Cartesian Coordinate Plane</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In order to visualize the pure excitement that is Precalculus,
      we need to unite Algebra and Geometry.
      Simply put, we must find a way to draw algebraic things.
      Let's start with possibly the greatest mathematical achievement of all time: the
          <idx><h>Cartesian coordinate plane</h></idx>
      <em>Cartesian Coordinate Plane</em>.
      Imagine two real number lines crossing at a right angle at <m>0</m> as drawn below.
    </p>

    <aside>
      <p>
        The Cartesian Plane is named in honour of <url href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes"><em>Ren&#xe9; Descartes</em></url>.
      </p>

    </p>

    <p>
      The horizontal number line is usually called the
          <idx><h><m>x</m>-axis</h></idx> <em><m>x</m>-axis</em>
      while the vertical number line is usually called the <idx><h><m>y</m>-axis</h></idx>
      <em><m>y</m>-axis</em>.
      As with the usual number line,
      we imagine these axes extending off indefinitely in both directions.
      Having two number lines allows us to locate the positions of points off of the number lines as well as points on the lines themselves.
    </p>

    <aside>
      <p>
        Usually extending off towards infinity is indicated by arrows,
        but here,
        the arrows are used to indicate the <em>direction</em>
        of increasing values of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
      </p>
    </aside>
    <aside>
      <p>
        The names of the coordinates can vary depending on the context of the application.
        If, for example,
        the horizontal axis represented time we might choose to call it the <m>t</m>-axis.
        The first number in the ordered pair would then be the <m>t</m>-coordinate.
      </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      For example, consider the point <m>P</m> on the next page.
      To use the numbers on the axes to label this point,
      we imagine dropping a vertical line from the <m>x</m>-axis to <m>P</m> and extending a horizontal line from the <m>y</m>-axis to <m>P</m>.
      This process is sometimes called <q>projecting</q>
      the point <m>P</m> to the <m>x</m>-
      (respectively <m>y</m>-)
      axis.
      We then describe the point <m>P</m> using the
          <idx><h>ordered pair</h></idx>
      <em>ordered pair</em> <m>(2,-4)</m>.
      The first number in the ordered pair is called the
          <idx><h>abscissa</h></idx> <em>abscissa</em>
      or <idx><h><m>x</m>-coordinate</h></idx>
      <em><m>x</m>-coordinate</em>
      and the second is called the <idx><h>ordinate</h></idx> <em>ordinate</em>
      or <idx><h><m>y</m>-coordinate</h></idx>
      <em><m>y</m>-coordinate</em>.
      Taken together, the ordered pair <m>(2,-4)</m> comprise the
          <idx><h>coordinates</h><h>Cartesian</h></idx><idx><h>Cartesian coordinates</h></idx>
      <em>Cartesian coordinates</em> of the point <m>P</m>.
      In practice,
      the distinction between a point and its coordinates is blurred;
      for example, we often speak of
      <q>the point <m>(2,-4)</m>.</q>
      We can think of <m>(2,-4)</m> as instructions on how to reach <m>P</m> from the
          <idx><h>origin</h></idx>
      <em>origin</em> <m>(0, 0)</m> by moving <m>2</m> units to the right and <m>4</m> units downwards.
      Notice that the order in the <em>ordered</em>
      pair is important <m>-</m> if we wish to plot the point <m>(-4,2)</m>,
      we would move to the left <m>4</m> units from the origin and then move upwards <m>2</m> units,
      as below on the right.

      When we speak of the Cartesian Coordinate Plane,
      we mean the set of all possible ordered pairs <m>(x,y)</m> as <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> take values from the real numbers.
      Below is a summary of important facts about Cartesian coordinates.

        Cartesian coordinates are sometimes referred to as
        <em>rectangular coordinates</em>,
        to distinguish them from other coordinate systems such as <em>polar coordinates</em>.

      The axes divide the plane into four regions called
          <idx><h>quadrants</h></idx>
      <em>quadrants</em>.
      They are labelled with Roman numerals and proceed counterclockwise around the plane:
      see <xref ref="quadrant">Figure</xref>.

      <caption>The four quadrants of the Cartesian plane</caption>

    <p>
      For example,
      <m>(1,2)</m> lies in Quadrant I, <m>(-1,2)</m> in Quadrant II, <m>(-1,-2)</m> in Quadrant III and <m>(1,-2)</m> in Quadrant IV. If a point other than the origin happens to lie on the axes,
      we typically refer to that point as lying on the positive or negative <m>x</m>-axis
      (if <m>y = 0</m>)
      or on the positive or negative <m>y</m>-axis (if <m>x = 0</m>).
      For example,
      <m>(0,4)</m> lies on the positive <m>y</m>-axis whereas
      <m>(-117,0)</m> lies on the negative <m>x</m>-axis.
      Such points do not belong to any of the four quadrants.

      One of the most important concepts in all of Mathematics is <em>symmetry</em>.
      There are many types of symmetry in Mathematics,
      but three of them can be discussed easily using Cartesian Coordinates.

      One way to visualize the processes in the previous example is with the concept of a
          <idx><h>reflection</h><h>of a point</h></idx>
      <em>reflection</em>.
      If we start with our point <m>(-2,3)</m> and pretend that the <m>x</m>-axis is a mirror,
      then the reflection of <m>(-2,3)</m> across the <m>x</m>-axis would lie at <m>(-2,-3)</m>.
      If we pretend that the <m>y</m>-axis is a mirror,
      the reflection of <m>(-2,3)</m> across that axis would be <m>(2,3)</m>.
      If we reflect across the <m>x</m>-axis and then the <m>y</m>-axis,
      we would go from <m>(-2,3)</m> to <m>(-2,-3)</m> then to <m>(2,-3)</m>,
      and so we would end up at the point symmetric to <m>(-2,3)</m> about the origin.
      We summarize and generalize this process below.

  <subsection>
    <title>Distance in the Plane</title>
    <p>
      Another important concept in Geometry is the notion of length.
      If we are going to unite Algebra and Geometry using the Cartesian Plane,
      then we need to develop an algebraic understanding of what distance in the plane means.
      Suppose we have two points,
      <m>P\left(x_{0}, y_{0}\right)</m> and <m>Q\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)</m>,
      in the plane.
      By the
          <idx><h>distance</h><h>definition</h></idx>
      <em>distance</em> <m>d</m> between <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>,
      we mean the length of the line segment joining <m>P</m> with <m>Q</m>. (Remember,
      given any two distinct points in the plane,
      there is a unique line containing both points.) Our goal now is to create an algebraic formula to compute the distance between these two points.
      Consider the generic situation in <xref ref="fig_cartdist">Figure</xref>.

      With a little more imagination,
      we can envision a right triangle whose hypotenuse has length <m>d</m> as drawn above on the right.
      From the latter figure,
      we see that the lengths of the legs of the triangle are <m>\left|x_{1} - x_{0}\right|</m> and
      <m>\left|y_{1} - y_{0}\right|</m> so the <url href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_Theorem"><em>Pythagorean Theorem</em></url> gives us
      <me>
        \left|x_{1} - x_{0}\right|^2 + \left|y_{1} - y_{0}\right|^2 = d^2

        \left(x_{1} - x_{0}\right)^2 + \left(y_{1} - y_{0}\right)^2 = d^2
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      (Do you remember why we can replace the absolute value notation with parentheses?) By extracting the square root of both sides of the second equation and using the fact that distance is never negative, we get

      It is not always the case that the points <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> lend themselves to constructing such a triangle.
      If the points <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are arranged vertically or horizontally,
      or describe the exact same point,
      we cannot use the above geometric argument to derive the distance formula.

      <em>midpoint</em> of the line segment connecting two points.
      Given two points,

      the <em>midpoint</em> <m>M</m> of <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> is defined to be the point on the line segment connecting <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> whose distance from <m>P</m> is equal to its distance from <m>Q</m>.

          The world is not flat. (There are those who disagree with this statement.
          Look them up on the Internet some time when you're bored.) Thus the Cartesian Plane cannot possibly be the end of the story.
          Discuss with your classmates how you would extend Cartesian Coordinates to represent the three dimensional world.
          What would the Distance and Midpoint formulas look like,
          assuming those concepts make sense at all?
