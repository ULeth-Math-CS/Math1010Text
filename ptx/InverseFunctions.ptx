  <title>Inverse Functions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Thinking of a function as a process like we did in <xref ref="FunctionNotation">Section</xref>,
      in this section we seek another function which might reverse that process.
      As in real life, we will find that some processes
      (like putting on socks and shoes)
      are reversible while some
      (like cooking a steak)
      are not.
      We start by discussing a very basic function which is reversible,
      <m>f(x) = 3x+4</m>.
      Thinking of <m>f</m> as a process,
      we start with an input <m>x</m> and apply two steps,
      as we saw in <xref ref="FunctionNotation">Section</xref>
          <idx><h>function</h><h>as a process</h></idx>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            multiply by <m>3</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            add <m>4</m>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      To reverse this process,
      we seek a function <m>g</m> which will undo each of these steps and take the output from <m>f</m>,
      <m>3x+4</m>, and return the input <m>x</m>.
      If we think of the real-world reversible two-step process of first putting on socks then putting on shoes,
      to reverse the process,
      we first take off the shoes,
      and then we take off the socks.
      In much the same way,
      the function <m>g</m> should undo the second step of <m>f</m> first.
      That is, the function <m>g</m> should

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>subtract</em> <m>4</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <em>divide</em> by <m>3</m>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      Following this procedure, we get <m>g(x) = \frac{x-4}{3}</m>.
      Let's check to see if the function <m>g</m> does the job.
      If <m>x=5</m>, then <m>f(5) = 3(5)+4 = 15+4 = 19</m>.
      Taking the output <m>19</m> from <m>f</m>,
      we substitute it into <m>g</m> to get <m>g(19) = \frac{19-4}{3} = \frac{15}{3} = 5</m>,
      which is our original input to <m>f</m>.
      To check that <m>g</m> does the job for all <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>f</m>,
      we take the generic output from <m>f</m>,
      <m>f(x) = 3x+4</m>, and substitute that into <m>g</m>.
      That is, <m>g(f(x)) = g(3x+4) = \frac{(3x+4)-4}{3} = \frac{3x}{3} = x</m>,
      which is our original input to <m>f</m>.
      If we carefully examine the arithmetic as we simplify <m>g(f(x))</m>,
      we actually see <m>g</m> first
      <q>undoing</q> the addition of <m>4</m>,
      and then <q>undoing</q>
      the multiplication by <m>3</m>.
      Not only does <m>g</m> undo <m>f</m>,
      but <m>f</m> also undoes <m>g</m>.
      That is, if we take the output from <m>g</m>,
      <m>g(x) = \frac{x-4}{3}</m>,
      and put that into <m>f</m>,
      we get <m>f(g(x)) = f\left(\frac{x-4}{3}\right) = 3 \left(\frac{x-4}{3}\right) + 4 = (x-4) + 4 = x</m>.
      Using the language of function composition developed in <xref ref="FunctionComposition">Section</xref>,
      the statements <m>g(f(x)) = x</m> and <m>f(g(x)) = x</m> can be written as
      <m>(g \circ f)(x) = x</m> and <m>(f \circ g)(x) = x</m>,
      respectively.
      Abstractly,
      we can visualize the relationship between <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> in <xref ref="fig_inverse1">Figure</xref>.

    </figure>

    <p>
      The main idea to get from <xref ref="fig_inverse1">Figure</xref>
      is that <m>g</m> takes the outputs from <m>f</m> and returns them to their respective inputs,
      and conversely,
      <m>f</m> takes outputs from <m>g</m> and returns them to their respective inputs.
      We now have enough background to state the central definition of the section.

      <xref ref="inversefunctionprops">Theorem</xref>
      is a consequence of <xref ref="inversefunctiondefn">Definition</xref>
      and the Fundamental Graphing Principle for Functions.
      We note the third property in <xref ref="inversefunctionprops">Theorem</xref>
      tells us that the graphs of inverse functions are reflections about the line <m>y=x</m>.
      For a proof of this,
      see <xref ref="inversemidpointex1">Example</xref> in <xref ref="CartesianPlane">Section</xref> and <xref ref="inversemidpointex2">Exercise</xref>
      in <xref ref="LinearFunctions">Section</xref>.
      For example,
      we plot the inverse functions <m>f(x) = 3x+4</m> and
      <m>g(x) = \dfrac{x-4}{3}</m> in <xref ref="fig_inverse2">Figure</xref>.

    </figure>

    <p>
      If we abstract one step further,
      we can express the sentiment in <xref ref="inversefunctiondefn">Definition</xref>
      by saying that <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are inverses if and only if <m>g \circ f = I_{1}</m> and
      <m>f \circ g = I_{2}</m> where <m>I_{1}</m> is the identity function restricted to the domain of <m>f</m> and <m>I_{2}</m> is the identity function restricted to the domain of <m>g</m>.
      In other words,
      <m>I_{1}(x) = x</m> for all <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>f</m> and
      <m>I_{2}(x) = x</m> for all <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>g</m>.
      Using this description of inverses along with the properties of function composition listed in <xref ref="functioncompprops">Theorem</xref>,
      we can show that function inverses are unique. (In other words,
      invertible functions have exactly one inverse.) Suppose <m>g</m> and <m>h</m> are both inverses of a function <m>f</m>.
      By <xref ref="inversefunctionprops">Theorem</xref>,
      the domain of <m>g</m> is equal to the domain of <m>h</m>,
      since both are the range of <m>f</m>.
      This means the identity function <m>I_{2}</m> applies both to the domain of <m>h</m> and the domain of <m>g</m>.
      Thus <m>h = h \circ I_{2} = h \circ (f \circ g) = (h \circ f) \circ g = I_{1} \circ g = g</m>,
      as required. (It is an excellent exercise to explain each step in this string of equalities.) We summarize the discussion of the last two paragraphs in the following theorem.

    <aside>
      <p>
        The identity function <m>I</m>,
        which was introduced in <xref ref="LinearFunctions">Section</xref>
        and mentioned in <xref ref="functioncompprops">Theorem</xref>,
        has a domain of all real numbers.
        Since the domains of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> may not be all real numbers,
        we need the restrictions listed here.

    <aside>
      <p>
        In the interests of full disclosure,
        the authors would like to admit that much of the discussion in the previous paragraphs could have easily been avoided had we appealed to the description of a function as a set of ordered pairs.
        We make no apology for our discussion from a function composition standpoint, however,
        since it exposes the reader to more abstract ways of thinking of functions and inverses.

    </theorem>

    <p>
      The notation <m>f^{-1}</m> is an unfortunate choice since you've been programmed since Elementary Algebra to think of this as <m>\frac{1}{f}</m>.
      This is most definitely <em>not</em> the case since, for instance,
      <m>f(x) = 3x+4</m> has as its inverse <m>f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x-4}{3}</m>,
      which is certainly different than <m>\frac{1}{f(x)} = \frac{1}{3x+4}</m>.
      Why does this confusing notation persist?
      As we mentioned in <xref ref="FunctionComposition">Section</xref>,
      the identity function <m>I</m> is to function composition what the real number <m>1</m> is to real number multiplication.
      The choice of notation <m>f^{-1}</m> alludes to the property that
      <m>f^{-1} \circ f = I_{1}</m> and <m>f \circ f^{-1} = I_{2}</m>,
      in much the same way as <m>3^{-1} \cdot 3 = 1</m> and <m>3 \cdot 3^{-1} = 1</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's turn our attention to the function <m>f(x) = x^2</m>.
      Is <m>f</m> invertible?
      A likely candidate for the inverse is the function <m>g(x) = \sqrt{x}</m>.
      Checking the composition yields <m>(g\circ f)(x) = g(f(x)) = \sqrt{x^2} = |x|</m>,
      which is not equal to <m>x</m> for all <m>x</m> in the domain <m>(-\infty, \infty)</m>.
      For example, when <m>x=-2</m>,
      <m>f(-2)= (-2)^2 = 4</m>, but <m>g(4) = \sqrt{4}=2</m>,
      which means <m>g</m> failed to return the input <m>-2</m> from its output <m>4</m>.
      What <m>g</m> did, however,
      is match the output <m>4</m> to a
      <em>different</em> input, namely <m>2</m>,
      which satisfies <m>f(2) = 4</m>.
      This issue is presented schematically in <xref ref="fig_inverse3">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="fig_inverse3">
      <caption>The function <m>f(x)=x^2</m> is not invertible</caption>
      <image source="figures/FurtherGraphics/InverseFunctions-3"></image>
    </figure>

    <p>
      We see from the diagram that since both <m>f(-2)</m> and <m>f(2)</m> are <m>4</m>,
      it is impossible to construct a <em>function</em>
      which takes <m>4</m> back to <em>both</em>
      <m>x=2</m> and <m>x=-2</m>. (By definition,
      a function matches a real number with exactly one other real number.) From a graphical standpoint,
      we know that if <m>y=f^{-1}(x)</m> exists,
      its graph can be obtained by reflecting <m>y=x^2</m> about the line <m>y=x</m>,
      in accordance with <xref ref="inverseuniquegraph">Theorem</xref>.
      Doing so takes the graph in <xref ref="fig_inverse4">Figure</xref>
      (a) to the one in <xref ref="fig_inverse4">Figure</xref> (b).

    <p>
      We see that the line <m>x=4</m> intersects the graph of the supposed inverse twice - meaning the graph fails the Vertical Line Test,
      <xref ref="VLT">Theorem</xref>, and as such,
      does not represent <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m>.
      The vertical line <m>x=4</m> on the graph on the right corresponds to the
      <em>horizontal line</em>
      <m>y=4</m> on the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m>.
      The fact that the horizontal line <m>y=4</m> intersects the graph of <m>f</m> twice means two
      <em>different</em> inputs,
      namely <m>x=-2</m> and <m>x=2</m>,
      are matched with the <em>same</em> output,
      <m>4</m>, which is the cause of all of the trouble.
      In general, for a function to have an inverse,
      <em>different</em> inputs must go to
      <em>different</em> outputs,
      or else we will run into the same problem we did with <m>f(x) = x^2</m>.
      We give this property a name.

        <p>
          \index {Horizontal Line Test (HLT)} A function <m>f</m> is one-to-one if and only if no horizontal line intersects the graph of <m>f</m> more than once.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      We say that the graph of a function <em>passes</em>
      the Horizontal Line Test if no horizontal line intersects the graph more than once;
      otherwise, we say the graph of the function
      <em>fails</em> the Horizontal Line Test.
      We have argued that if <m>f</m> is invertible,
      then <m>f</m> must be one-to-one,
      otherwise the graph given by reflecting the graph of
      <m>y = f(x)</m> about the line <m>y = x</m> will fail the Vertical Line Test.
      It turns out that being one-to-one is also enough to guarantee invertibility.
      To see this,
      we think of <m>f</m> as the set of ordered pairs which constitute its graph.
      If switching the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-coordinates of the points results in a function,
      then <m>f</m> is invertible and we have found <m>f^{-1}</m>.
      This is precisely what the Horizontal Line Test does for us:
      it checks to see whether or not a set of points describes <m>x</m> as a function of <m>y</m>.
      We summarize these results below.

      We have shown that the functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> in <xref ref="inversefunctiononetooneex">Example</xref> are one-to-one.
      This means they are invertible,
      so it is natural to wonder what
      <m>f^{-1}(x)</m> and <m>g^{-1}(x)</m> would be.
      For <m>f(x) = \frac{1-2x}{5}</m>,
      we can think our way through the inverse since there is only one occurrence of <m>x</m>.
      We can track step-by-step what is done to <m>x</m> and reverse those steps as we did at the beginning of the chapter.
      The function <m>g(x) = \frac{2x}{1-x}</m> is a bit trickier since <m>x</m> occurs in two places.
      When one evaluates <m>g(x)</m> for a specific value of <m>x</m>,
      which is first,
      the <m>2x</m> or the <m>1-x</m>?
      We can imagine functions more complicated than these so we need to develop a general methodology to attack this problem.
      <xref ref="inversefunctionprops">Theorem</xref>
      tells us equation <m>y = f^{-1}(x)</m> is equivalent to
      <m>f(y) = x</m> and this is the basis of our algorithm.

                Note that the vertical asymptote <m>x=1</m> of the graph of <m>g</m> corresponds to the horizontal asymptote <m>y=1</m> of the graph of <m>g^{-1}</m>,

      We get <m>g^{-1}(x) = \sqrt{x}</m>.
      At first it looks like we'll run into the same trouble as before,
      but when we check the composition,
      the domain restriction on <m>g</m> saves the day.
      We get <m>\left(g^{-1} \circ g\right) (x) = g^{-1}(g(x)) = g^{-1}\left(x^2\right) = \sqrt{x^2} = |x| = x</m>,
      since <m>x \geq 0</m>.
      Checking <m>\left( g \circ g^{-1}\right)(x) = g\left(g^{-1}(x)\right) = g\left(\sqrt{x}\right) = \left(\sqrt{x}\right)^2 = x</m>.
      Graphing <m>g</m> and <m>g^{-1}</m> on the same set of axes in <xref ref="fig_inverse12">Figure</xref>
      shows that they are reflections about the line <m>y=x</m>.

      <title>Inverting a price function</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Recall from <xref ref="LinearFunctions">Section</xref>
          that the price-demand equation for the PortaBoy game system is
          <m>p(x) = -1.5x + 250</m> for <m>0 \leq x \leq 166</m>,
          where <m>x</m> represents the number of systems sold weekly and <m>p</m> is the price per system in dollars.

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Explain why <m>p</m> is one-to-one and find a formula for <m>p^{-1}(x)</m>.
                State the restricted domain.

                Find and interpret <m>p^{-1}(220)</m>.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Recall from <xref ref="QuadraticFunctions">Section</xref>
                that the weekly profit <m>P</m>, in dollars,
                as a result of selling <m>x</m> systems is given by <m>P(x)= -1.5x^2+170x-150</m>.

              <p>
                Use your answer to part 3 to determine the price per PortaBoy which would yield the maximum profit.
                Compare with <xref ref="PortaBoyProfit">Example</xref>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                We leave to the reader to show the graph of
                <m>p(x) = -1.5x + 250</m>, <m>0 \leq x \leq 166</m>,
                is a line segment from <m>(0,250)</m> to <m>(166,1)</m>,
                and as such passes the Horizontal Line Test.
                Hence, <m>p</m> is one-to-one.
                We find the expression for
                <m>p^{-1}(x)</m> as usual and get <m>p^{-1}(x) = \frac{500-2x}{3}</m>.
                The domain of <m>p^{-1}</m> should match the range of <m>p</m>,
                which is <m>[1,250]</m>, and as such,
                we restrict the domain of <m>p^{-1}</m> to <m>1 \leq x \leq 250</m>.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                We find <m>p^{-1}(220) = \frac{500-2(220)}{3} = 20</m>.
                Since the function <m>p</m> took as inputs the weekly sales and furnished the price per system as the output,
                <m>p^{-1}</m> takes the price per system and returns the weekly sales as its output.
                Hence,
          <m>p^{-1}(220) = 20</m> means <m>20</m> systems will be sold in a week if the price is set at <m>\dollar 220</m> per system.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                We compute <m>\left( P \circ p^{-1}\right)(x) = P \left(p^{-1}(x)\right) = P\left(\frac{500-2x}{3}\right) = -1.5\left(\frac{500-2x}{3}\right)^2+170\left(\frac{500-2x}{3}\right)-150</m>.
                After a hefty amount of Elementary Algebra,
                (it is good review to actually do this!)
                we obtain <m>\left( P \circ p^{-1}\right)(x) = -\frac{2}{3} x^2 +220x - \frac{40450}{3}</m>.
                To understand what this means,
                recall that the original profit function <m>P</m> gave us the weekly profit as a function of the weekly sales.
                The function <m>p^{-1}</m> gives us the weekly sales as a function of the price.
                Hence, <m>P \circ p^{-1}</m> takes as its input a price.
                The function <m>p^{-1}</m> returns the weekly sales,
                which in turn is fed into <m>P</m> to return the weekly profit.
                Hence,
          <m>\left(P \circ p^{-1}\right)(x)</m> gives us the weekly profit
                (in dollars)
                as a function of the price per system, <m>x</m>,
                using the weekly sales
          <m>p^{-1}(x)</m> as the <q>middle man</q>.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                We know from <xref ref="QuadraticFunctions">Section</xref>
                that the graph of <m>y = \left( P \circ p^{-1}\right)(x)</m> is a parabola opening downwards.
                The maximum profit is realized at the vertex.
                Since we are concerned only with the price per system,
                we need only find the <m>x</m>-coordinate of the vertex.
                Identifying <m>a = -\frac{2}{3}</m> and <m>b = 220</m>,
                we get, by the Vertex Formula,
                <xref ref="vertexofquadraticfunctions">Equation</xref>,
                <m>x = -\frac{b}{2a} = 165</m>.
                Hence,
          weekly profit is maximized if we set the price at <m>\dollar165</m> per system.
                Comparing this with our answer from <xref ref="PortaBoyProfit">Example</xref>,
                there is a slight discrepancy to the tune of <m>\dollar0.50</m>.
                We leave it to the reader to balance the books appropriately.

              <m>0 \leq x \leq 450</m>.
              The graph of <m>y = \left(P\circ p^{-1}\right)(x)</m> is a parabola opening downwards with vertex <m>\left(275, \frac{125}{3}\right) \approx (275, 41.67)</m>.
              This means that the maximum profit is a whopping
              <m>\dollar41.67</m> when the price per dOpi is set to <m>\dollar275</m>.
              At this price,
              we can produce and sell <m>p^{-1}(275) = 11.\overline{6}</m> dOpis.
              Since we cannot sell part of a system,
              we need to adjust the price to sell either <m>11</m> dOpis or <m>12</m> dOpis.
              We find <m>p(11) = 285</m> and <m>p(12) = 270</m>,
              which means we set the price per dOpi at either
              <m>\dollar285</m> or <m>\dollar270</m>, respectively.
              The profits at these prices are
              <m>\left(P\circ p^{-1}\right)(285) = 35</m> and <m>\left(P\circ p^{-1}\right)(270) = 40</m>,
              so it looks as if the maximum profit is
              <m>\dollar40</m> and it is made by producing and selling <m>12</m> dOpis a week at a price of <m>\dollar270</m> per dOpi.
