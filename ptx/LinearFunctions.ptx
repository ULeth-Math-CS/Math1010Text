  <title>Linear Functions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We now begin the study of families of functions.
      Our first family, linear functions,
      are old friends as we shall soon see.
      Recall from Geometry that two distinct points in the plane determine a unique line containing those points,
      as indicated in <xref ref="fig_linfun1">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

      <caption>The line between two points <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m></caption>
      <image source="figures/LinearQuadraticGraphics/LinearFunctions-1"></image>
    </figure>

    <p>
      To give a sense of the <q>steepness</q> of the line,
      we recall that we can compute the <em>slope</em>
      of the line using the formula below.

              <idx><h>slope</h><h>definition</h></idx> <term>slope</term>
          <m>m</m> of the line containing the points
          <m>P\left(x_{0}, y_{0}\right)</m> and <m>Q\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)</m> is:

          <me>
            m  = \dfrac{y_{1} - y_{0}}{x_{1} - x_{0}}

          provided <m>x_{1} \neq x_{0}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      A couple of notes about <xref ref="slope">Definition</xref> are in order.
      First, don't ask why we use the letter
      <q><m>m</m></q> to represent slope.
      There are many explanations out there,
      but apparently no one really knows for sure.
      Secondly, the stipulation
      <m>x_{1} \neq x_{0}</m> ensures that we aren't trying to divide by zero.
      The reader is invited to pause to think about what is happening geometrically;
      the anxious reader can skip along to the next example.

    <p>
      A few comments about <xref ref="slopeex">Example</xref> are in order.
      First, for reasons which will be made clear soon,
      if the slope is positive then the resulting line is said to be increasing.
      If it is negative, we say the line is decreasing.
      A slope of <m>0</m> results in a horizontal line which we say is constant,
      and an undefined slope results in a vertical line.
      Second, the larger the slope is in absolute value, the steeper the line.
      You may recall from high school that slope can be described as the ratio
      <q><m>\frac{\mbox{ rise} }{\mbox{ run} }</m></q>.
      For example,
      in the second part of <xref ref="slopeex">Example</xref>,
      we found the slope to be <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>.
      We can interpret this as a rise of 1 unit upward for every <m>2</m> units to the right we travel along the line,
      as shown in <xref ref="fig_riserun">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="fig_riserun">
      <caption>Slope as <q>rise over run</q></caption>
      <image source="figures/LinearQuadraticGraphics/LinearFunctions-8"></image>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Using more formal notation,
      given points <m>\left(x_{0}, y_{0}\right)</m> and <m>\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)</m>,
      we use the Greek letter delta <q><m>\Delta</m></q>
      to write <m>\Delta y = y_{1} - y_{0}</m> and <m>\Delta x = x_{1} - x_{0}</m>.
      In most scientific circles, the symbol <m>\Delta</m> means <q>change in</q>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hence, we may write
      <me>
        m = \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}
      </me>,
      which describes the slope as the
          <idx><h>slope</h><h>rate of change</h></idx><idx><h>rate of change</h><h>slope of a line</h></idx>
      <em>rate of change</em> of <m>y</m> with respect to <m>x</m>.
      Rates of change abound in the <q>real world</q>,
      as the next example illustrates.

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                For the slope,
                we have <m>m = \frac{8 - 2}{10 - 6} = \frac{6}{4} = \frac{3}{2}</m>.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Since the values in the numerator correspond to the temperatures in
                <m>^{\circ}</m>C, and the values in the denominator correspond to time in hours,
                we can interpret the slope as <m>\dfrac{3}{2} = \dfrac{3^{\circ} \, \mbox{ C} }{2 \, \mbox{ hour} }</m>,
                or <m>1.5^{\circ}</m>C per hour.
                Since the slope is positive,
                we know this corresponds to an increasing line.
                Hence,
          the temperature is increasing at a rate of <m>1.5^{\circ}</m>C per hour.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Noon is two hours after <m>10</m> AM. Assuming a temperature increase of <m>1.5^{\circ}</m>C per hour,
                in two hours the temperature should rise
                <m>3^{\circ}</m>C. Since the temperature at <m>10</m> AM is
                <m>8^{\circ}</m>C, we would expect the temperature at noon to be <m>8+3=11^{\circ}</m>C.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      Now it may well happen that in the previous scenario,
      at noon the temperature is only
      <m>10^{\circ}</m>C. This doesn't mean our calculations are incorrect, rather,
      it means that the temperature change throughout the day isn't a constant <m>1.5^{\circ}</m>C per hour.
      As discussed in <xref ref="modeling">Section</xref>,
      mathematical models are just that: models.
      The predictions we get out of the models may be mathematically accurate,
      but may not resemble what happens in the real world.
    </p>

    <p>
      In <xref ref="Relations">Section</xref>,
      we discussed the equations of vertical and horizontal lines.
      Using the concept of slope,
      we can develop equations for the other varieties of lines.
      Suppose a line has a slope of <m>m</m> and contains the point <m>\left(x_{0}, y_{0}\right)</m>.
      Suppose <m>(x,y)</m> is another point on the line,
      as indicated in <xref ref="fig_linfun2">Figure</xref>.

        <p>
          In order to use <xref ref="pointslope">Key Idea</xref>
          we need to find the slope of the line in question so we use <xref ref="slope">Definition</xref>
          to get <m>m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{1 - 3}{2 - (-1)} = -\frac{2}{3}</m>.
          We are spoiled for choice for a point <m>\left(x_{0}, y_{0}\right)</m>.
          We'll use <m>(-1,3)</m> and leave it to the reader to check that using <m>(2,1)</m> results in the same equation.
          Substituting into the point-slope form of the line, we get
          <md>
            <mrow>y - y_{0} \amp  = m\left(x - x_{0}\right)</mrow>

        <p>
          We can check our answer by showing that both <m>(-1,3)</m> and <m>(2,1)</m> are on the graph of <m>y = -\frac{2}{3} x + \frac{7}{3}</m> algebraically,

    <p>
      In simplifying the equation of the line in the previous example,
      we produced another form of a line,
      the <em>slope-intercept form</em>.
      This is the familiar <m>y = mx + b</m> form you have probably seen in high school.
      The <q>intercept</q> in <q>slope-intercept</q>
      comes from the fact that if we set <m>x=0</m>, we get <m>y = b</m>.
      In other words,
      the <m>y</m>-intercept of the line <m>y = mx + b</m> is <m>(0,b)</m>.

      Note that if we have slope <m>m = 0</m>,

      The formula given in <xref ref="slopeintercept">Key Idea</xref>
      can be used to describe all lines except vertical lines.
      All lines except vertical lines are functions (Why is this?) so we have finally reached a good point to introduce
      <em>linear functions</em>.

      Recall that to graph a function, <m>f</m>,
      we graph the equation <m>y=f(x)</m>.
      Hence, the graph of a linear function is a line with slope <m>m</m> and <m>y</m>-intercept <m>(0,b)</m>;
      the graph of a constant function is a horizontal line (a line with slope <m>m = 0</m>) and a <m>y</m>-intercept of <m>(0,b)</m>.
      Now think back to <xref ref="genfuncbehavior">Section</xref>,
      specifically <xref ref="incdeccnstdefn">Definition</xref> concerning increasing,
      decreasing and constant functions.
      A line with positive slope was called an increasing line because a linear function with <m>m > 0</m> is an increasing function.
      Similarly, a line with a negative slope was called a decreasing line because a linear function with <m>m \lt 0</m> is a decreasing function.
      And horizontal lines were called constant because, well,
      we hope you've already made the connection.

                The graph of <m>f(x) = 3x-1</m> is the graph of the line <m>y = 3x-1</m>.
                Comparison of this equation with <xref ref="slopeintercept">Equation</xref>
                yields <m>m=3</m> and <m>b = -1</m>.
                Hence,
          our slope is <m>3</m> and our <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>(0,-1)</m>.
                To get another point on the line,
                we can plot <m>(1,f(1)) = (1,2)</m>.
                Constructing the line through these points gives us <xref ref="fig_linfun4">Figure</xref>. <figure xml:id="fig_linfun4"> <caption>The graph of

                At first glance, the function
                <m>f(x) = \dfrac{3 - 2x}{4}</m> does not fit the form in <xref ref="linearfunction">Definition</xref>
                but after some rearranging we get <m>f(x) = \frac{3 - 2x}{4} = \frac{3}{4} - \frac{2x}{4} = -\frac{1}{2} x + \frac{3}{4}</m>.
                We identify <m>m = -\frac{1}{2}</m> and <m>b = \frac{3}{4}</m>.
                Hence, our graph is a line with a slope of
                <m>-\frac{1}{2}</m> and a <m>y</m>-intercept of <m>\left(0, \frac{3}{4}\right)</m>.
                Plotting an additional point,
                we can choose <m>(1,f(1))</m> to get <m>\left(1, \frac{1}{4}\right)</m>:
                see <xref ref="fig_linfun5">Figure</xref>. <figure xml:id="fig_linfun5"> <caption>The graph of

            <li>
              <p>
                If we simplify the expression for <m>f</m>, we get
                <me>
                  f(x) = \dfrac{x^2-4}{x-2} = \dfrac{\cancel{(x-2)}(x+2)}{\cancel{(x-2)}} = x+2
                </me>.
                If we were to state <m>f(x) = x+2</m>,
                we would be committing a sin of omission.
                Remember, to find the domain of a function,
                we do so <em>before</em> we simplify!
                In this case,
                <m>f</m> has big problems when <m>x=2</m>, and as such,
                the domain of <m>f</m> is <m>(-\infty, 2) \cup (2,\infty)</m>.
                To indicate this, we write <m>f(x) = x+2</m>, <m>x \neq 2</m>.
                So, except at <m>x=2</m>,
          we graph the line <m>y = x+2</m>.
                The slope <m>m =1</m> and the <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>(0,2)</m>.
                A second point on the graph is <m>(1,f(1)) = (1,3)</m>.
                Since our function <m>f</m> is not defined at <m>x=2</m>,
                we put an open circle at the point that would be on the line <m>y=x+2</m> when <m>x=2</m>,
                namely <m>(2,4)</m>, as shown in <xref ref="fig_linfun6">Figure</xref>.

    <p>
      The last two functions in the previous example showcase some of the difficulty in defining a linear function using the phrase <q>of the form</q>
      as in <xref ref="linearfunction">Definition</xref>,
      since some algebraic manipulations may be needed to rewrite a given function to match <q>the form</q>.
      Keep in mind that the domains of linear and constant functions are all real numbers <m>(-\infty, \infty)</m>,
      so while <m>f(x) = \frac{x^2-4}{x-2}</m> simplified to a formula <m>f(x) = x+2</m>,
      <m>f</m> is not considered a linear function since its domain excludes <m>x=2</m>.
      However, we would consider
      <me>
        f(x) = \dfrac{2x^2 + 2}{x^2+1}
      </me>
      to be a constant function since its domain is all real numbers (Can you tell us why?) and
      <me>
        f(x) = \dfrac{2x^2 + 2}{x^2+1} = \dfrac{2\cancel{\left(x^2+1\right)}}{\cancel{\left(x^2+1\right)}} = 2

                Like any slope, we can interpret this as a rate of change.
                Here, <m>C(x)</m> is the cost in dollars,

                We recall from <xref ref="FunctionNotation">Section</xref>
                the meaning of <q>independent</q>
                and <q>dependent</q> variable.
                Since <m>x</m> is to be the independent variable,
                and <m>p</m> the dependent variable,
                we treat <m>x</m> as the input variable and <m>p</m> as the output variable.
                Hence,
          we are looking for a function of the form <m>p(x) = mx + b</m>.
                To determine <m>m</m> and <m>b</m>,
                we use the fact that <m>20</m> PortaBoys were sold during the week when the price was <m>220</m> dollars and <m>40</m> units were sold when the price was <m>190</m> dollars.
                Using function notation,
                these two facts can be translated as
                <m>p(20)=220</m> and <m>p(40)=190</m>.
                Since <m>m</m> represents the rate of change of <m>p</m> with respect to <m>x</m>, we have
                <me>
                  m = \dfrac{\Delta p}{\Delta x} = \dfrac{190-220}{40-20} = \dfrac{-30}{20} = -1.5
                </me>.
                We now have determined <m>p(x) = -1.5 x + b</m>.
                To determine <m>b</m>,
          we can use our given data again.
                Using <m>p(20) = 220</m>,
                we substitute <m>x=20</m> into
                <m>p(x) = 1.5x + b</m> and set the result equal to <m>220</m>:
                <m>-1.5(20)+b = 220</m>.
                Solving, we get  <m>b = 250</m>.
                Hence, we get <m>p(x) = -1.5x + 250</m>.
                We can check our formula by computing <m>p(20)</m> and <m>p(40)</m> to see if we get <m>220</m> and <m>190</m>,
                respectively.
                You may recall from <xref ref="pricerevenuecostprofit">page</xref>
                that the function <m>p(x)</m> is called the price-demand

                However,
          we also note that the slope of this linear function is negative,
                and as such, the price is decreasing as more units are sold.
                Thus another constraint on the price is <m>p(x)\geq 0</m>.
                Solving <m>-1.5 x + 250 \geq 0</m> results in
                <m>-1.5 x \geq -250</m> or <m>x \leq \dfrac{500}{3} = 166.\overline{6}</m>.
                Since <m>x</m> represents the number of PortaBoys sold in a week,
                we round down to <m>166</m>.
                As a result,
                a reasonable applied domain for <m>p</m> is <m>[0,166]</m>.

            <li>
              <p>
                The slope <m>m = -1.5</m>, once again,
                represents the rate of change of the price of a system with respect to weekly sales of PortaBoys.
                Since the slope is negative,
                we have that the price is decreasing at a rate of
                <m>\dollar1.50</m> per PortaBoy sold. (Said differently,
                you can sell one more PortaBoy for every <m>\dollar1.50</m> drop in price.)
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                To determine the price which will move <m>150</m> PortaBoys,
                we find <m>p(150) = -1.5(150) + 250 = 25</m>.
                That is, the price would have to be <m>\dollar25</m>.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                If the price of a PortaBoy were set at <m>\dollar150</m>,
                we have <m>p(x) = 150</m>,
          or, <m>-1.5x + 250 = 150</m>.
                Solving,
          we get <m>-1.5x = -100</m> or <m>x = 66.\overline{6}</m>.
                This means you would be able to sell <m>66</m> PortaBoys a week if the price were <m>\dollar150</m> per system.

      Not all real-world phenomena can be modelled using linear functions.
      Nevertheless,
      it is possible to use the concept of slope to help analyze non-linear functions using the following.

      <title>Average rate of change</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f</m> be a function defined on the interval <m>[a,b]</m>.
          The
              <idx><h>average rate of change</h></idx><idx><h>rate of change</h><h>average</h></idx>
          <term>average rate of change</term>
          of <m>f</m> over <m>[a,b]</m> is defined as:
          <me>

    </definition>

    <p>
      Geometrically, if we have the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m>,
      the average rate of change over <m>[a,b]</m> is the slope of the line which connects <m>(a,f(a))</m> and <m>(b,f(b))</m>.
      This is called the
          <idx><h>secant line</h></idx>
      <em>secant line</em> through these points.
      For that reason, some textbooks use the notation
      <m>m_{\sec}</m> for the average rate of change of a function.
      Note that for a linear function <m>m = m_{\sec}</m>, or in other words,
      its rate of change over an interval is the same as its average rate of change.

      The interested reader may question the adjective <q>average</q>
      in the phrase <q>average rate of change</q>.
      In the figure above,
      we can see that the function changes wildly on <m>[a,b]</m>,
      yet the slope of the secant line only captures a snapshot of the action at <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
      This situation is entirely analogous to the average speed on a trip.
      Suppose it takes you <m>2</m> hours to travel <m>100</m> kilometres.
      Your average speed is <m>\frac{100 \, \mbox{ km} }{2 \, \mbox{ h} } = 50 \, \mbox{km/h}</m>.
      However, it is entirely possible that at the start of your journey,
      you travelled <m>25</m> kilometres per hour,
      then sped up to <m>65</m> kilometres per hour, and so forth.
      The average rate of change is akin to your average speed on the trip.
      Your speedometer measures your speed at any one instant along the trip, your
          <idx><h>rate of change</h><h>instantaneous</h></idx><idx><h>instantaneous rate of change</h></idx>
      <em>instantaneous rate of change</em>,
      and this is one of the central themes of Calculus.

      When interpreting rates of change,
      we interpret them the same way we did slopes.
      In the context of functions,
      it may be helpful to think of the average rate of change as:
      <me>
        \dfrac{\mbox{change in outputs} }{\mbox{change in inputs} }

                to get <m>R(x) = x (-1.5x + 250) = -1.5x^2+250x</m>.
                Since we determined the price-demand function <m>p(x)</m> is restricted to <m>0 \leq x \leq 166</m>,
                <m>R(x)</m> is restricted to these values of <m>x</m> as well.

              <p>
                Using <xref ref="arc">Definition</xref>,
                we get that the average rate of change is
                <me>
                  \dfrac{\Delta R}{\Delta x} = \dfrac{R(50) - R(0)}{50 - 0} = \dfrac{8750 - 0}{50 - 0} = 175
                </me>.
                Interpreting this slope as we have in similar situations,
                we conclude that for every additional PortaBoy sold during a given week,
                the weekly revenue increases <m>\dollar 175</m>.
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                The wording of this part is slightly different than that in <xref ref="arc">Definition</xref>,
                but its meaning is to find the average rate of change of <m>R</m> over the interval <m>[50,100]</m>.
                To find this rate of change, we compute
                <me>
                  \dfrac{\Delta R}{\Delta x} = \dfrac{R(100) - R(50)}{100-50} = \dfrac{10000 - 8750}{50} = 25
                </me>.
                In other words, for each additional PortaBoy sold,
                the revenue increases by <m>\dollar25</m>.
                Note that while the revenue is still increasing by selling more game systems,
                we aren't getting as much of an increase as we did in part 2 of this example. (Can you think of why this would happen?)
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Translating the English to the mathematics,
                we are being asked to find the average rate of change of <m>R</m> over the interval <m>[100,150]</m>.
                We find
                <me>
                  \dfrac{\Delta R}{\Delta x} = \dfrac{R(150) - R(100)}{150-100} = \dfrac{3750 - 10000}{50} = -125
                </me>.
                This means that we are losing
                <m>\dollar125</m> dollars of weekly revenue for each additional PortaBoy sold.  (Can you think why this is possible?)

    <p>
      We close this section with a new look at difference quotients which were first introduced in <xref ref="FunctionNotation">Section</xref>.
      If we wish to compute the average rate of change of a function <m>f</m> over the interval <m>[x, x+h]</m>,
      then we would have
      <me>
        \dfrac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} = \dfrac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{(x+h) - x} = \dfrac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      As we have indicated, the rate of change of a function
      (average or otherwise)
      is of great importance in Calculus. (So we are not torturing you with these for nothing.) Also,
      we have the geometric interpretation of difference quotients which was promised to you back on <xref ref="diffquotgeompromise">page</xref>
      <mdash /> a difference quotient yields the slope of a secant line.

          Legend has it that a bull Sasquatch in rut will howl approximately 9 times per hour when it is
          <m>40^{\circ}F</m> outside and only 5 times per hour if it's <m>70^{\circ}F</m>.
          Assuming that the number of howls per hour, <m>N</m>,
          can be represented by a linear function of temperature Fahrenheit,
          find the number of howls per hour he'll make when it's only <m>20^{\circ}F</m> outside.
          What is the applied domain of this function?
          Why?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          <m>N(T) = -\frac{2}{15}T + \frac{43}{3}</m> and <m>N(20) = \frac{35}{3} \approx 12</m> howls per hour.
        </p>

        <p>
          Having a negative number of howls makes no sense and since
          <m>N(107.5) = 0</m> we can put an upper bound of <m>107.5^{\circ}F</m> on the domain.
          The lower bound is trickier because there's nothing other than common sense to go on.
          As it gets colder, he howls more often.
          At some point it will either be so cold that he freezes to death or he's howling non-stop.
          So we're going to say that he can withstand temperatures no lower than
          <m>-60^{\circ}F</m> so that the applied domain is <m>[-60, 107.5]</m>.

      <statement>
        <p>
          We shall now prove that <m>y = m_{1}x + b_{1}</m> is perpendicular to
          <m>y = m_{2}x + b_{2}</m> if and only if <m>m_{1} \cdot m_{2} = -1</m>.
          To make our lives easier we shall assume that
          <m>m_{1} > 0</m> and <m>m_{2} \lt 0</m>.
          We can also <q>move</q>
          the lines so that their point of intersection is the origin without messing things up,
          so we'll assume <m>b_{1} = b_{2} = 0</m>. (Take a moment with your classmates to discuss why this is okay.) Graphing the lines and plotting the points <m>O(0, 0)\;</m>,
          <m>P(1, m_{1})\;</m> and <m>Q(1, m_{2})</m> gives us the following set up. <image source="figures/LinearQuadraticGraphics/LinearFunctions-16"></image>
        </p>

        <p>
          The line <m>y = m_{1}x</m> will be perpendicular to the line
          <m>y = m_{2}x</m> if and only if <m>\bigtriangleup OPQ</m> is a right triangle.
          Let <m>d_{1}</m> be the distance from <m>O</m> to <m>P</m>,
          let <m>d_{2}</m> be the distance from <m>O</m> to <m>Q</m> and let <m>d_{3}</m> be the distance from <m>P</m> to <m>Q</m>.
          Use the Pythagorean Theorem to show that
          <m>\bigtriangleup OPQ</m> is a right triangle if and only if <m>m_{1} \cdot m_{2} = -1</m> by showing
          <m>d_{1}^{2} + d_{2}^{2} = d_{3}^2</m> if and only if <m>m_{1} \cdot m_{2} = -1</m>.
