  <title>The Polar Form of Complex Numbers</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section,
      we return to our study of complex numbers which were first introduced in <xref ref="ComplexZeros">Section</xref>.
      Recall that a
          <idx><h>complex number </h><h> definition of</h></idx>
      <em>complex number</em> is a number of the form
      <m>z = a + bi</m> where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are real numbers and <m>i</m> is the imaginary unit defined by <m>i = \sqrt{-1}</m>.
      The number <m>a</m> is called the
          <idx><h>complex number </h><h> real part</h></idx> <em>real part</em>
      <idx><h>real part of a complex number</h></idx> of <m>z</m>,
      denoted <m>\operatorname{Re}(z)</m>,
      while the real number <m>b</m> is called the <idx><h>imaginary part of a complex number</h></idx> <idx><h>complex number </h><h> imaginary part</h></idx>
      <em>imaginary part</em> of <m>z</m>,
      denoted <m>\operatorname{Im}(z)</m>.
      From Intermediate Algebra,
      we know that if <m>z = a + bi = c + di</m> where <m>a</m>,
      <m>b</m>,
      <m>c</m> and <m>d</m> are real numbers,
      then <m>a = c</m> and <m>b = d</m>,
      which means <m>\operatorname{Re}(z)</m> and <m>\operatorname{Im}(z)</m> are well-defined.
      To start off this section,
      we associate each complex number
      <m>z = a+bi</m> with the point <m>(a,b)</m> on the coordinate plane.
      In this case, the <m>x</m>-axis is relabeled as the
          <idx><h>real axis</h></idx><em>real axis</em>,
      which corresponds to the real number line as usual,
      and the <m>y</m>-axis is relabeled as the <idx><h>imaginary axis</h></idx>
      <em>imaginary axis</em>,
      which is demarcated in increments of the imaginary unit <m>i</m>.
      The plane determined by these two axes is called the
          <idx><h>complex plane</h></idx>
      <em>complex plane</em>.
    </p>

    <aside>
      <p>
        Saying that <m>\operatorname{Re}(z)</m> and
        <m>\operatorname{Im}(z)</m> are <q>well-defined</q>
        means that no matter how we express <m>z</m>,
        the number <m>\operatorname{Re}(z)</m> is always the same,
        and the number <m>\operatorname{Im}(z)</m> is always the same.
        In other words,
        <m>\operatorname{Re}</m> and <m>\operatorname{Im}</m> are
        <em>functions</em> of complex numbers.

    <p>
      Since the ordered pair <m>(a,b)</m> gives the <em>rectangular</em>
      coordinates associated with the complex number <m>z = a+bi</m>,
      the expression <m>z=a+bi</m> is called the
          <idx><h>complex number </h><h> rectangular form</h></idx><idx><h>rectangular form of a complex number</h></idx>
      <em>rectangular form</em> of <m>z</m>.
      Of course, we could just as easily associate <m>z</m> with a pair of <em>polar</em>
      coordinates <m>(r,\theta)</m>.
      Although it is not as straightforward as the definitions of
      <m>\operatorname{Re}(z)</m> and <m>\operatorname{Im}(z)</m>,
      we can still give <m>r</m> and <m>\theta</m> special names in relation to <m>z</m>.

    <p>
      Some remarks about <xref ref="modulusargumentdefn">Definition</xref> are in order.
      We know from <xref ref="IntroPolar">Section</xref>
      that every point in the plane has infinitely many polar coordinate representations
      <m>(r,\theta)</m> which means it's worth our time to make sure the quantities <q>modulus</q>,
      <q>argument</q> and <q>principal argument</q> are well-defined.
      Concerning the modulus,
      if <m>z = 0</m> then the point associated with <m>z</m> is the origin.
      In this case, the <em>only</em>
      <m>r</m>-value which can be used here is <m>r=0</m>.
      Hence for <m>z= 0</m>, <m>|z| = 0</m> is well-defined.
      If <m>z \neq 0</m>,
      then the point associated with <m>z</m> is not the origin,
      and there are <em>two</em> possibilities for <m>r</m>:
      one positive and one negative.
      However, we stipulated <m>r \geq 0</m> in our definition so this pins down the value of <m>|z|</m> to one and only one number.
      Thus the modulus is well-defined in this case,
      too. (In case you're wondering,
      the use of the absolute value notation <m>|z|</m> for modulus will be explained shortly.) Even with the requirement <m>r \geq 0</m>,
      there are infinitely many angles <m>\theta</m> which can be used in a polar representation of a point <m>(r,\theta)</m>.
      If <m>z \neq 0</m> then the point in question is not the origin,
      so all of these angles <m>\theta</m> are coterminal.
      Since coterminal angles are exactly <m>2\pi</m> radians apart,
      we are guaranteed that only one of them lies in the interval <m>(-\pi, \pi]</m>,
      and this angle is what we call the principal argument of <m>z</m>,
      <m>\operatorname{Arg}(z)</m>.
      In fact, the set <m>\operatorname{arg}(z)</m> of \text{ all } arguments of <m>z</m> can be described using set-builder notation as <m>\operatorname{arg}(z) = \left\{ \operatorname{Arg}(z) + 2\pi k \, | \, \text{ \(k\) is an integer } \right\}</m>.
      Note that since <m>\operatorname{arg}(z)</m> is a <em>set</em>,
      we will write <q><m>\theta \in \operatorname{arg}(z)</m></q>
      to mean <q><m>\theta</m> is in the set of arguments of <m>z</m></q>.
      If <m>z=0</m> then the point in question is the origin,
      which we know can be represented in polar coordinates as <m>(0,\theta)</m> for
      <em>any</em> angle <m>\theta</m>.
      In this case,
      we have <m>\operatorname{arg}(0) = (-\infty, \infty)</m> and since there is no one value of <m>\theta</m> which lies <m>(-\pi, \pi]</m>,
      we leave <m>\operatorname{Arg}(0)</m> undefined.
      It is time for an example.

              <p>
                For <m>z = \sqrt{3} -i = \sqrt{3} + (-1)i</m>,
                we have <m>\operatorname{Re}(z) = \sqrt{3}</m> and <m>\operatorname{Im}(z) = -1</m>.
                To find <m>|z|</m>,
                <m>\operatorname{arg}(z)</m> and <m>\operatorname{Arg}(z)</m>,
                we need to find a polar representation
                <m>(r,\theta)</m> with <m>r \geq 0</m> for the point
                <m>P(\sqrt{3},-1)</m> associated with <m>z</m>.
                We know <m>r^2 = (\sqrt{3})^2 + (-1)^2 = 4</m>,
          so <m>r = \pm 2</m>.
                Since we require <m>r \geq 0</m>,
                we choose <m>r =2</m>, so <m>|z| = 2</m>.
                Next, we find a corresponding angle <m>\theta</m>.
                Since <m>r>0</m> and <m>P</m> lies in Quadrant IV, <m>\theta</m> is a Quadrant IV angle.
                We know <m>\tan(\theta) = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}</m>,
                so <m>\theta = -\frac{\pi}{6} + 2\pi k</m> for integers <m>k</m>.
                Hence,
          <m>\operatorname{arg}(z) = \left\{-\frac{\pi}{6} + 2\pi k \, | \, \text{ \(k\) is an integer } \right\}</m>.
                Of these values,
                only <m>\theta = -\frac{\pi}{6}</m> satisfies the requirement that <m>-\pi \lt \theta \leq \pi</m>,
                hence <m>\operatorname{Arg}(z) = -\frac{\pi}{6}</m>.

            <li>
              <p>
                The complex number <m>z = -2+4i</m> has <m>\operatorname{Re}(z) = -2</m>,
                <m>\operatorname{Im}(z) = 4</m>,
                and is associated with the point <m>P(-2,4)</m>.
                Our next task is to find a polar representation
                <m>(r,\theta)</m> for <m>P</m> where <m>r \geq 0</m>.
                Running through the usual calculations gives <m>r = 2\sqrt{5}</m>,
                so <m>|z| = 2\sqrt{5}</m>.
                To find <m>\theta</m>,
          we get <m>\tan(\theta) = -2</m>,
                and since <m>r > 0</m> and <m>P</m> lies in Quadrant II, we know <m>\theta</m> is a Quadrant II angle.
                We find <m>\theta = \pi + \arctan(-2) + 2\pi k</m>, or,
                more succinctly <m>\theta = \pi - \arctan(2) + 2\pi k</m> for integers <m>k</m>.
                Hence <m>\operatorname{arg}(z) = \left\{\pi - \arctan(2) + 2\pi k \, | \, \text{ \(k\) is an integer } \right\}</m>.
                Only <m>\theta = \pi - \arctan(2)</m> satisfies the requirement <m>-\pi \lt \theta \leq \pi</m>,
                so <m>\operatorname{Arg}(z) = \pi - \arctan(2)</m>.

            <li>
              <p>
                We rewrite <m>z = 3i</m> as <m>z = 0+3i</m> to find
                <m>\operatorname{Re}(z) = 0</m> and <m>\operatorname{Im}(z) = 3</m>.
                The point in the plane which corresponds to <m>z</m> is <m>(0,3)</m> and while we could go through the usual calculations to find the required polar form of this point,
                we can almost <q>see</q> the answer.
                The point <m>(0,3)</m> lies <m>3</m> units away from the origin on the positive <m>y</m>-axis.
                Hence, <m>r=|z|=3</m> and
                <m>\theta = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2\pi k</m> for integers <m>k</m>.
                We get <m>\operatorname{arg}(z) = \left\{ \frac{\pi}{2} + 2\pi k \, | \, \text{ \(k\) is an integer } \right\}</m> and <m>\operatorname{Arg}(z) = \frac{\pi}{2}</m>.

            <p>
              As in the previous problem,
              we write <m>z = -117 = -117 + 0i</m> so
              <m>\operatorname{Re}(z) = -117</m> and <m>\operatorname{Im}(z) = 0</m>.
              The number <m>z = -117</m> corresponds to the point <m>(-117,0)</m>,
              and this is another instance where we can determine the polar form <q>by eye</q>.
              The point <m>(-117,0)</m> is <m>117</m> units away from the origin along the negative <m>x</m>-axis.
              Hence, <m>r=|z|=117</m> and
              <m>\theta = \pi + 2\pi = (2k+1)\pi k</m> for integers <m>k</m>.
              We have <m>\operatorname{arg}(z) = \left\{ (2k+1)\pi \, | \, k \text{ is an integer } \right\}</m>.
              Only one of these values, <m>\theta = \pi</m>,
              just barely lies in the interval
              <m>(-\pi, \pi]</m> which means and <m>\operatorname{Arg}(z) =\pi</m>.

      To prove the first three properties in <xref ref="modprops">Theorem</xref>,
      suppose <m>z = a + bi</m> where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are real numbers.
      To determine <m>|z|</m>,
      we find a polar representation <m>(r,\theta)</m> with
      <m>r \geq 0</m> for the point <m>(a,b)</m>.
      From <xref ref="IntroPolar">Section</xref>,
      we know <m>r^2 = a^2 + b^2</m> so that <m>r = \pm \sqrt{a^2+b^2}</m>.
      Since we require <m>r \geq 0</m>,
      then it must be that <m>r = \sqrt{a^2 +b^2}</m>,
      which means <m>|z| = \sqrt{a^2+b^2}</m>.
      Using the distance formula,
      we find the distance from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>(a,b)</m> is also <m>\sqrt{a^2+b^2}</m>,
      establishing the first property.
      For the second property,
      note that since <m>|z|</m> is a distance, <m>|z| \geq 0</m>.
      Furthermore,
      <m>|z| = 0</m> if and only if the distance from <m>z</m> to <m>0</m> is <m>0</m>,
      and the latter happens if and only if <m>z = 0</m>,
      which is what we were asked to show.
      For the third property,
      we note that since <m>a = \operatorname{Re}(z)</m> and <m>b = \operatorname{Im}(z)</m>,
      <m>z = \sqrt{a^2+b^2} = \sqrt{\operatorname{Re}(z)^2 + \operatorname{Im}(z)^2}</m>.

        Since the absolute value <m>|x|</m> of a real number <m>x</m> can be viewed as the distance from <m>x</m> to <m>0</m> on the number line,
        the first property in <xref ref="modprops">Theorem</xref>
        justifies the notation <m>|z|</m> for modulus.
        We leave it to the reader to show that if <m>z</m> is real,
        then the definition of modulus coincides with absolute value so the notation <m>|z|</m> is unambiguous.

      To prove the product rule,

      <m>b</m>, <m>c</m> and <m>d</m>.
      Then <m>zw = (a+bi)(c+di)</m>.
      After the usual arithmetic we get
      <m>zw = (ac-bd) + (ad+bc)i</m>. (See <xref ref="complexzeroex1">Example</xref>

        we can work through the underlying Algebra to see this is true.

        <m>\sqrt{a^2+b^2} = 0</m> if and only if <m>a^2+b^2 = 0</m>,

      Now that the Product Rule has been established,
      we use it and the Principle of Mathematical Induction to prove the power rule.
      Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>\left|z^{n}\right| = |z|^n</m>.
      Then <m>P(1)</m> is true since <m>\left|z^{1}\right| = |z| = |z|^1</m>.
      Next, assume <m>P(k)</m> is true.
      That is, assume <m>\left|z^{k}\right| = |z|^k</m> for some <m>k \geq 1</m>.
      Our job is to show that <m>P(k+1)</m> is true,
      namely <m>\left|z^{k+1}\right| = |z|^{k+1}</m>.
      As is customary with induction proofs,
      we first try to reduce the problem in such a way as to use the Induction Hypothesis.
      <md>
        <mrow>\left|z^{k+1}\right| \amp  =  \left|z^{k} z\right|  \tag{Properties of Exponents}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  =  \left|z^{k}\right| |z|  \tag{Product Rule}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  =   |z|^{k} |z|  \tag{Induction Hypothesis}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  =   |z|^{k+1}  \tag{Properties of Exponents}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      Hence, <m>P(k+1)</m> is true,
      which means <m>\left|z^{n}\right| = |z|^{n}</m> is true for all natural numbers <m>n</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Like the Power Rule,
      the Quotient Rule can also be established with the help of the Product Rule.
      We assume <m>w \neq 0</m>
      (so <m>|w| \neq 0</m>)
      and we get
      <md>
        <mrow>\left| \dfrac{z}{w} \right| \amp   =  \left| (z) \left( \dfrac{1}{w} \right) \right|</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  =  |z| \left| \dfrac{1}{w}\right|  \tag{Product Rule.}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      Hence, the proof really boils down to showing <m>\left| \frac{1}{w} \right| = \frac{1}{|w|}</m>.
      This is left as an exercise.

      To prove <xref ref="argprops">Theorem</xref>,
      suppose <m>z = a + bi</m> for real numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
      By definition,
      <m>a = \operatorname{Re}(z)</m> and <m>b = \operatorname{Im}(z)</m>,
      so the point associated with <m>z</m> is <m>(a,b) = \left(\operatorname{Re}(z), \operatorname{Im}(z)\right)</m>.
      From <xref ref="IntroPolar">Section</xref>,
      we know that if <m>(r,\theta)</m> is a polar representation for <m>\left(\operatorname{Re}(z), \operatorname{Im}(z)\right)</m>,
      then <m>\tan(\theta) = \frac{\operatorname{Im}(z)}{\operatorname{Re}(z)}</m>,
      provided <m>\operatorname{Re}(z) \neq 0</m>.
      If <m>\operatorname{Re}(z) = 0</m> and <m>\operatorname{Im}(z) > 0</m>,
      then <m>z</m> lies on the positive imaginary axis.
      Since we take <m>r > 0</m>,
      we have that <m>\theta</m> is coterminal with
      <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m>, and the result follows.
      If <m>\operatorname{Re}(z) = 0</m> and <m>\operatorname{Im}(z) \lt 0</m>,
      then <m>z</m> lies on the negative imaginary axis,
      and a similar argument shows <m>\theta</m> is coterminal with <m>-\frac{\pi}{2}</m>.
      The last property in the theorem was already discussed in the remarks following <xref ref="modulusargumentdefn">Definition</xref>.

      We know from <xref ref="polarrectangularconversion">Theorem</xref>

      Making these substitutions for <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> gives <m>z = a + bi = r\cos(\theta) + r \sin(\theta) i = r \left[\cos(\theta) + i \sin(\theta)\right]</m>.

                      It is a good exercise to actually show that this polar form reduces to <m>z=-2+4i</m>.

                      This can be checked geometrically.

                      <m>|z| = 117</m> and <m>\theta = \pi</m>.
                      We get <m>z = 117 \operatorname{cis}(\pi)</m>.
                      As with the previous problem,
                      our answer is easily checked geometrically.

        While the notation <m>\operatorname{cis}(\theta) = \cos(\theta)+ i\sin(\theta)</m> is not uncommon,
        it is not the most popular.
        In light of <xref ref="prodquotpolarcomplex">Theorem</xref>,
        one can make sense of the polar form using
        <em>Euler's formula</em>
        <me>
          e^{i\theta} = \cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta)

        The appearance of the exponential function in this context might seem strange,
        but note that the three properties in <xref ref="prodquotpolarcomplex">Theorem</xref>
        can then be understood in terms of laws of exponents.
        If <m>z=re^{i\alpha}</m> and <m>w=se^{i\beta}</m>, we have
        <me>
          zw = (rs)\left(e^{i\alpha}e^{i\beta}\right) = (rs)e^{i(\alpha+\beta)}
        </me>,

          z^n = r^n(e^{i\alpha})^n = r^ne^{in\alpha}

    <p>
      The proof of <xref ref="prodquotpolarcomplex">Theorem</xref>
      requires a healthy mix of definition,
      arithmetic and identities.
      We first start with the product rule.
      <md>
        <mrow>zw \amp  =  \left[|z|\operatorname{cis}(\alpha)\right] \left[|w|\operatorname{cis}(\beta)\right]</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  =  |z||w|\left[\cos(\alpha) + i\sin(\alpha)\right]\left[\cos(\beta) + i \sin(\beta)\right]</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      We now focus on the quantity in brackets on the right hand side of the equation.
      <md>
        <mrow>\left[\cos(\alpha) + i\sin(\alpha)\right]\amp \left[\cos(\beta) + i \sin(\beta)\right]</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  = \cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta) + i\cos(\alpha)\sin(\beta)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp   + i\sin(\alpha)\cos(\beta) + i^2 \sin(\alpha)\sin(\beta)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  =  \cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta) +  i^2 \sin(\alpha) \sin(\beta) \tag{Rearranging terms}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp   + \, i\sin(\alpha)\cos(\beta) +i\cos(\alpha)\sin(\beta)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  =  \left(\cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta) - \sin(\alpha) \sin(\beta)\right)\tag{Since $i^2 = -1$}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  +  i\left(\sin(\alpha)\cos(\beta)+ \cos(\alpha)\sin(\beta)\right)  \tag{Factor out $i$}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  = \cos(\alpha + \beta) + i \sin(\alpha+\beta)  \tag{Sum identities}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  = \operatorname{cis}(\alpha + \beta)  \tag{Definition of `cis'}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      Putting this together with our earlier work,
      we get <m>zw = |z| |w| \operatorname{cis}(\alpha + \beta)</m>,
      as required.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moving right along, we next take aim at the Power Rule,
      better known as DeMoivre's Theorem. (Compare this proof with the proof of the Power Rule in <xref ref="modprops">Theorem</xref>.) We proceed by induction on <m>n</m>.
      Let <m>P(n)</m> be the sentence <m>z^{n} = |z|^{n} \operatorname{cis}(n \theta)</m>.
      Then <m>P(1)</m> is true,
      since <m>z^{1} = z = |z| \operatorname{cis}(\theta) = |z|^{1} \operatorname{cis}(1\cdot \theta)</m>.
      We now assume <m>P(k)</m> is true, that is,
      we assume <m>z^{k} = |z|^{k} \operatorname{cis}(k \theta)</m> for some <m>k \geq 1</m>.
      Our goal is to show that <m>P(k+1)</m> is true,
      or that <m>z^{k+1} = |z|^{k+1} \operatorname{cis}((k+1)\theta)</m>.
      We have
      <md>
        <mrow>z^{k+1} \amp  =  z^{k} z  \tag{Properties of Exponents}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  =  \left(|z|^{k} \operatorname{cis}(k \theta)\right) \left(|z| \operatorname{cis}(\theta)\right) \tag{Induction Hypothesis}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  =  \left(|z|^k |z|\right) \operatorname{cis}(k \theta + \theta)  \tag{Product Rule}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  =  |z|^{k+1} \operatorname{cis}((k+1)\theta)</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      Hence, assuming <m>P(k)</m> is true,
      we have that <m>P(k+1)</m> is true,
      so by the Principle of Mathematical Induction,
      <m>z^{n} = |z|^{n} \operatorname{cis}(n \theta)</m> for all natural numbers <m>n</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The last property in <xref ref="prodquotpolarcomplex">Theorem</xref>
      to prove is the quotient rule.
      Assuming <m>|w| \neq 0</m> we have
      <md>
        <mrow>\dfrac{z}{w} \amp  =  \dfrac{|z| \operatorname{cis}(\alpha)}{|w| \operatorname{cis}(\beta)}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  =  \left( \dfrac{|z|}{|w|}\right) \dfrac{\cos(\alpha) + i \sin(\alpha)}{\cos(\beta) + i \sin(\beta)}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      Next, we multiply both the numerator and denominator of the right hand side by
      <m>(\cos(\beta) - i \sin(\beta))</m> which is the complex conjugate of <m>(\cos(\beta) + i \sin(\beta))</m> to get
      <me>
        \dfrac{z}{w}   =  \left( \dfrac{|z|}{|w|}\right) \dfrac{\cos(\alpha) + i \sin(\alpha)}{\cos(\beta) + i \sin(\beta)} \cdot \dfrac{\cos(\beta) - i \sin(\beta)}{\cos(\beta) - i \sin(\beta)}
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      If we let the numerator be <m>N = \left[\cos(\alpha) + i \sin(\alpha)\right] \left[\cos(\beta) - i \sin(\beta)\right]</m> and simplify we get
      <md>
        <mrow>N \amp  = \left[\cos(\alpha) + i \sin(\alpha)\right] \left[\cos(\beta) - i \sin(\beta)\right]</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  =  \cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta)-i\cos(\alpha)\sin(\beta)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp   + i \sin(\alpha)\cos(\beta) - i^2 \sin(\alpha)\sin(\beta)  \tag{Expand}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  =  \left[\cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta)+\sin(\alpha)\sin(\beta)\right]</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  + i\left[\sin(\alpha)\cos(\beta) -\cos(\alpha)\sin(\beta)  \right]  \tag{Rearrange and Factor}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  = \cos(\alpha - \beta) + i \sin(\alpha - \beta)   \tag{Difference Identities}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  =  \operatorname{cis}(\alpha - \beta) \tag{Definition of `cis'}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      If we call the denominator <m>D</m> then we get
      <md>
        <mrow>D \amp  =  \left[\cos(\beta) + i\sin(\beta)\right]\left[\cos(\beta) - i\sin(\beta)\right]</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  =  \cos^{2}(\beta) - i\cos(\beta)\sin(\beta)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp   + i\cos(\beta)\sin(\beta) - i^2 \sin^{2}(\beta)  \tag{Expand}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  =  \cos^{2}(\beta) - i^2 \sin^{2}(\beta)  \tag{Simplify}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  =  \cos^{2}(\beta) + \sin^{2}(\beta)   \tag{Again, $i^{2} = -1$}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  =    1   \tag{Pythagorean Identity}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      Putting it all together, we get
      <md>
        <mrow>\dfrac{z}{w} \amp  =  \left( \dfrac{|z|}{|w|}\right) \dfrac{\cos(\alpha) + i \sin(\alpha)}{\cos(\beta) + i \sin(\beta)} \cdot \dfrac{\cos(\beta) - i \sin(\beta)}{\cos(\beta) - i \sin(\beta)}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  =  \left( \dfrac{|z|}{|w|}\right) \dfrac{\operatorname{cis}(\alpha - \beta)}{1}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  =   \dfrac{|z|}{|w|} \operatorname{cis}(\alpha - \beta)</mrow>

          In order to use <xref ref="prodquotpolarcomplex">Theorem</xref>,

          we know <m>\tan(\theta) = \frac{\operatorname{Im}(z)}{\operatorname{Re}(z)} = \frac{2}{2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}</m>.
          Since <m>z</m> lies in Quadrant I, we have
          <m>\theta = \frac{\pi}{6} + 2\pi k</m> for integers <m>k</m>.
          Hence, <m>z = 4 \operatorname{cis}\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right)</m>.
          For <m>w = -1 + i\sqrt{3}</m>,
          we have <m>|w| = \sqrt{(-1)^2+(\sqrt{3})^2} = 2</m>.

    <p>
      Some remarks are in order.
      First, the reader may not be sold on using the polar form of complex numbers to multiply complex numbers <mdash /> especially if they aren't given in polar form to begin with.
      Indeed, a lot of work was needed to convert the numbers <m>z</m> and <m>w</m> in <xref ref="polararithmeticex">Example</xref>
      into polar form, compute their product,
      and convert back to rectangular form <mdash /> certainly more work than is required to multiply out
      <m>zw =  (2\sqrt{3} + 2i)(-1 + i\sqrt{3})</m> the old-fashioned way.
      However, <xref ref="prodquotpolarcomplex">Theorem</xref>
      pays huge dividends when computing powers of complex numbers.
      Consider how we computed <m>w^{5}</m> above and compare that to using the Binomial Theorem to accomplish the same feat by expanding <m>(-1 + i\sqrt{3})^{5}</m>.
      Division is tricky in the best of times,
      and we saved ourselves a lot of time and effort using <xref ref="prodquotpolarcomplex">Theorem</xref>
      to find and simplify <m>\frac{z}{w}</m> using their polar forms as opposed to starting with <m>\frac{2\sqrt{3} + 2i}{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}</m>,
      rationalizing the denominator, and so forth.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is geometric reason for studying these polar forms and we would be derelict in our duties if we did not mention the Geometry hidden in <xref ref="prodquotpolarcomplex">Theorem</xref>.
      Take the product rule, for instance.
      If <m>z = |z| \operatorname{cis}(\alpha)</m> and <m>w = |w| \operatorname{cis}(\beta)</m>,
      the formula <m>zw = |z||w| \operatorname{cis}(\alpha + \beta)</m> can be viewed geometrically as a two step process.
      The multiplication of <m>|z|</m> by <m>|w|</m> can be interpreted as magnifying the distance <m>|z|</m> from <m>z</m> to <m>0</m>,
      by the factor <m>|w|</m>. (Assuming <m>|w| > 1</m>.) Adding the argument of <m>w</m> to the argument of <m>z</m> can be interpreted geometrically as a rotation of <m>\beta</m> radians counter-clockwise. (Assuming
      <m>\beta > 0</m>.) Focusing on <m>z</m> and <m>w</m> from <xref ref="polararithmeticex">Example</xref>,
      we can arrive at the product <m>zw</m> by plotting <m>z</m>,
      doubling its distance from <m>0</m>

      We may also visualize division similarly.
      Here, the formula <m>\frac{z}{w} = \frac{|z|}{|w|} \operatorname{cis}(\alpha - \beta)</m> may be interpreted as shrinking (again,
      assuming <m>|w| > 1</m>) the distance from <m>0</m> to <m>z</m> by the factor <m>|w|</m>,
      followed up by a <em>clockwise</em> rotation (again,

      In the case of <m>z</m> and <m>w</m> from <xref ref="polararithmeticex">Example</xref>,

    <p>
      Unlike <xref ref="principalnthrootdefn2">Definition</xref>
      in <xref ref="AlgebraicFunctions">Section</xref>,
      we do not specify one particular
      <em>prinicpal</em> <m>n^{\text{ th } }</m> root,
      hence the use of the indefinite article <q>an</q>
      as in <q>an <m>n^{\text{ th } }</m> root of <m>z</m></q>.
      Using this definition,
      both <m>4</m> and <m>-4</m> are square roots of <m>16</m>,
      while <m>\sqrt{16}</m> means the principal square root of <m>16</m> as in <m>\sqrt{16}= 4</m>.
      Suppose we wish to find all complex third (cube) roots of <m>8</m>.
      Algebraically, we are trying to solve <m>w^{3} = 8</m>.
      We know that there is only one
      <em>real</em> solution to this equation,
      namely <m>w = \sqrt[3]{8} = 2</m>,
      but if we take the time to rewrite this equation as <m>w^3 - 8 = 0</m> and factor,
      we get <m>(w-2)\left(w^2 + 2w + 4\right) = 0</m>.
      The quadratic factor gives two more cube roots <m>w = -1 \pm i \sqrt{3}</m>,
      for a total of three cube roots of <m>8</m>.
      In accordance with <xref ref="complexfactorization">Theorem</xref>,
      since the degree of <m>p(w) = w^3 -8</m> is three,
      there are three complex zeros, counting multiplicity.
      Since we have found three distinct zeros,
      we know these are all of the zeros,
      so there are exactly three distinct cube roots of <m>8</m>.
      Let us now solve this same problem using the machinery developed in this section.
      To do so, we express <m>z = 8</m> in polar form.
      Since <m>z=8</m> lies <m>8</m> units away on the positive real axis,
      we get <m>z = 8 \operatorname{cis}(0)</m>.
      If we let <m>w = |w| \operatorname{cis}(\alpha)</m> be a polar form of <m>w</m>,
      the equation <m>w^3 = 8</m> becomes
      <md>
        <mrow>w^3 \amp  =  8</mrow>
        <mrow>\left(|w| \operatorname{cis}(\alpha)\right)^3 \amp  = 8 \operatorname{cis}(0)</mrow>
        <mrow>|w|^3 \operatorname{cis}(3\alpha) \amp  =  8 \operatorname{cis}(0)  \tag{DeMoivre's Theorem}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      The complex number on the left hand side of the equation corresponds to the point with polar coordinates <m>\left(|w|^3, 3\alpha\right)</m>,
      while the complex number on the right hand side corresponds to the point with polar coordinates <m>(8,0)</m>.
      Since <m>|w| \geq 0</m>, so is <m>|w|^3</m>,
      which means <m>\left(|w|^3, 3\alpha\right)</m> and <m>(8,0)</m> are two polar representations corresponding to the same complex number,
      both with positive <m>r</m> values.
      From <xref ref="IntroPolar">Section</xref>,
      we know <m>|w|^3 = 8</m> and
      <m>3\alpha = 0 + 2\pi k</m> for integers <m>k</m>.
      Since <m>|w|</m> is a real number,
      we solve <m>|w|^3 = 8</m> by extracting the principal cube root to get <m>|w| = \sqrt[3]{8} = 2</m>.
      As for <m>\alpha</m>, we get
      <m>\alpha = \frac{2\pi k}{3}</m> for integers <m>k</m>.
      This produces three distinct points with polar coordinates corresponding to <m>k = 0</m>,
      <m>1</m> and <m>2</m>:
      specifically <m>(2,0)</m>,
      <m>\left(2, \frac{2\pi}{3}\right)</m> and <m>\left(2, \frac{4\pi}{3}\right)</m>.
      These correspond to the complex numbers <m>w_{0} = 2 \operatorname{cis}(0)</m>,
      <m>w_{1} = 2 \operatorname{cis}\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right)</m> and <m>w_{2} = 2 \operatorname{cis}\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)</m>,
      respectively.
      Writing these out in rectangular form yields <m>w_{0} = 2</m>,
      <m>w_{1} = -1 + i\sqrt{3}</m> and <m>w_{2} = -1-i\sqrt{3}</m>.
      While this process seems a tad more involved than our previous factoring approach,
      this procedure can be generalized to find, for example,
      all of the fifth roots of <m>32</m>. (Try using <xref ref="Polynomials">Chapter</xref>
      techniques on that!) If we start with a generic complex number in polar form <m>z = |z| \operatorname{cis}(\theta)</m> and solve
      <m>w^{n} = z</m> in the same manner as above,
      we arrive at the following theorem.
    </p>

          <m>z</m> has <m>n</m> distinct <m>n^{\text{ th } }</m> roots,
          which we denote by <m>w_{0}</m>, <m>w_{1}</m>,
          <ellipsis />, <m>w_{n-1}</m>,
          and they are given by the formula

          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      The proof of <xref ref="nthrootscomplexthm">Theorem</xref> breaks into to two parts:
      first, showing that each <m>w_{k}</m> is an <m>n^{\text{ th } }</m> root,
      and second,
      showing that the set <m>\left\{ w_{k} \, | \, k = 0, 1, \ldots, (n-1)\right\}</m> consists of <m>n</m> different complex numbers.
      To show <m>w_{k}</m> is an <m>n^{\text{ th } }</m> root of <m>z</m>,
      we use DeMoivre's Theorem to show <m>\left(w_{k}\right)^n = z</m>.
      <md>
        <mrow>\left(w_{k}\right)^n \amp  =  \left(\sqrt[n]{r}\operatorname{cis}\left(\frac{\theta}{n} + \frac{2\pi}{n} k \right)\right)^n</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  =  \left(\sqrt[n]{r}\right)^{n} \operatorname{cis}\left( n \cdot \left[\frac{\theta}{n} + \frac{2\pi}{n} k \right] \right)  \tag{DeMoivre's Theorem}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  =  r \operatorname{cis}\left(\theta + 2\pi k\right)</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      Since <m>k</m> is a whole number,
      <m>\cos(\theta + 2\pi k) = \cos(\theta)</m> and <m>\sin(\theta + 2\pi k) = \sin(\theta)</m>.
      Hence, it follows that <m>\operatorname{cis}(\theta + 2\pi k) = \operatorname{cis}(\theta)</m>,
      so <m>\left(w_{k}\right)^n = r \operatorname{cis}(\theta) = z</m>,
      as required.
      To show that the formula in <xref ref="nthrootscomplexthm">Theorem</xref>
      generates <m>n</m> distinct numbers, we assume <m>n \geq 2</m>
      (or else there is nothing to prove)
      and note that the modulus of each of the <m>w_{k}</m> is the same,
      namely <m>\sqrt[n]{r}</m>.
      Therefore, the only way any two of these polar forms correspond to the same number is if their arguments are coterminal <mdash /> that is,
      if the arguments differ by an integer multiple of <m>2\pi</m>.
      Suppose <m>k</m> and <m>j</m> are whole numbers between <m>0</m> and <m>(n-1)</m>,
      inclusive, with <m>k \neq j</m>.
      Since <m>k</m> and <m>j</m> are different,
      let's assume for the sake of argument that <m>k > j</m>.
      Then <m>\left( \frac{\theta}{n} + \frac{2\pi}{n} k \right)  - \left( \frac{\theta}{n} + \frac{2\pi}{n} j \right) = 2\pi \left(\frac{k-j}{n}\right)</m>.
      For this to be an integer multiple of <m>2\pi</m>,
      <m>(k-j)</m> must be a multiple of <m>n</m>.
      But because of the restrictions on <m>k</m> and <m>j</m>,
      <m>0 \lt  k - j \leq n-1</m>. (Think this through.) Hence,
      <m>(k-j)</m> is a positive number less than <m>n</m>,
      so it cannot be a multiple of <m>n</m>.
      As a result,
      <m>w_{k}</m> and <m>w_{j}</m> are different complex numbers,
      and we are done.
      By <xref ref="complexfactorization">Theorem</xref>,
      we know there at most <m>n</m> distinct solutions to <m>w^{n} = z</m>,
      and we have just found all of them.
      We illustrate <xref ref="nthrootscomplexthm">Theorem</xref> in the next example.

                We know that <m>z</m> has two square roots,

                we'll call them <m>w_{0}</m> and <m>w_{1}</m>.
                We get <m>w_{0} = \sqrt{4} \operatorname{cis}\left(\frac{(2\pi/3)}{2} + \frac{2\pi}{2} (0)\right) = 2\operatorname{cis}\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right)</m> and <m>w_{1} = \sqrt{4} \operatorname{cis}\left(\frac{(2\pi/3)}{2} + \frac{2\pi}{2} (1)\right) = 2\operatorname{cis}\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)</m>.
                In rectangular form, the two square roots of <m>z</m> are

                We can check our answers by squaring them and showing that we get <m>z= -2 + 2i\sqrt{3}</m>.
                We've plotted the position of the two square roots along the circle <m>r=2</m> in <xref ref="fig_polarroot1">Figure</xref>. <figure xml:id="fig_polarroot1"> <caption>The two square roots of

                With <m>r = 16</m>, <m>\theta = \pi</m> and <m>n = 4</m>,
                we get the four fourth roots of <m>z</m> to be <m>w_{0} = \sqrt[4]{16} \operatorname{cis}\left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{2\pi}{4} (0)\right) = 2\operatorname{cis}\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)</m>,
                <m>w_{1} = \sqrt[4]{16} \operatorname{cis}\left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{2\pi}{4} (1)\right) = 2\operatorname{cis}\left(\frac{3\pi}{4}\right)</m>,

                Converting these to rectangular form gives <m>w_{0} = \sqrt{2} + i\sqrt{2}</m>,

                <m>\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}</m> and <m>n =3</m> the usual computations yield <m>w_{0} = \sqrt[3]{2} \operatorname{cis}\left(\frac{\pi}{12}\right)</m>,

                If we were to convert these to rectangular form,
                we would need to use either the Sum and Difference Identities in <xref ref="circularsumdifference">Theorem</xref>

                to evaluate <m>w_{0}</m> and <m>w_{2}</m>.
                Since we are not explicitly told to do so,
                we leave this as a good, but messy, exercise,
                and plot the points in <xref ref="fig_polarroot3">Figure</xref>. <figure xml:id="fig_polarroot3"> <caption>The three third roots of

                To find the five fifth roots of <m>1</m>,
                we write <m>1 = 1 \operatorname{cis}(0)</m>.
                We have <m>r = 1</m>, <m>\theta = 0</m> and <m>n = 5</m>.
                Since <m>\sqrt[5]{1} = 1</m>,
                the roots are <m>w_{0} = \operatorname{cis}(0) = 1</m>,
                <m>w_{1} = \operatorname{cis}\left(\frac{2\pi}{5}\right)</m>,

                The situation here is even graver than in the previous example,
                since we have not developed any identities to help us determine the cosine or sine of <m>\frac{2\pi}{5}</m>.
                At this stage,
                we could approximate our answers using a calculator,
                and we leave this as an exercise.
                Once more, we plot the roots,
                which in this case all lie on the unit circle. <figure xml:id="fig_polarroot4"> <caption>The five fifth roots of <m>1</m></caption> <img src="figures/AppExtGraphics/PolarComplex04.pdf"/> </figure>

      Notice the geometric interpretation given in <xref ref="fig_polarroot1">Figures</xref>- <xref ref="fig_polarroot4"></xref>.
      Essentially, <xref ref="nthrootscomplexthm">Theorem</xref>
      says that to find the <m>n^{\text{ th } }</m> roots of a complex number,
      we first take the <m>n^{\text{ th } }</m> root of the modulus and divide the argument by <m>n</m>.
      This gives the first root <m>w_{0}</m>.
      Each successive root is found by adding <m>\frac{2\pi}{n}</m> to the argument,
      which amounts to rotating <m>w_{0}</m> by <m>\frac{2\pi}{n}</m> radians.
      This results in <m>n</m> roots,
      spaced equally around the complex plane.

    <p>
      We have only glimpsed at the beauty of the complex numbers in this section.
      The complex plane is without a doubt one of the most important mathematical constructs ever devised.
      Coupled with Calculus,
      it is the venue for incredibly important Science and Engineering applications.
      For now, the following exercises will have to suffice.

      Let <m>p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0</m> be a polynomial.
      If <m>p(a)=0</m>,
      then <m>a</m> is a <m>zero</m> of the polynomial and a solution of the equation <m>p(x)=0</m>.
      Furthermore, <m>(x-a)</m> is a <m>factor</m> of the polynomial.

      <em> Fundamental Theorem of Algebra</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      An <m>n</m>th degree polynomial has <m>n</m>
      (not necessarily distinct)
      zeros.
      Although all of these zeros may be imaginary,
      a real polynomial of odd degree must have at least one real zero.
