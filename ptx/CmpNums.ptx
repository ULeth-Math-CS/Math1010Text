  <title>Complex Numbers</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We conclude our first chapter with a review the set of
      <em>Complex Numbers</em>.
          <idx><h>numbers </h><h> complex</h></idx><idx><h>complex numbers</h></idx>
      As you may recall,
      the complex numbers fill an algebraic gap left by the real numbers.
      There is no real number <m>x</m> with <m>x^2 = -1</m>,
      since for any real number <m>x^2 \geq 0</m>.
      However, we could formally extract square roots and write <m>x = \pm \sqrt{-1}</m>.
      We build the complex numbers by relabelling the quantity <m>\sqrt{-1}</m> as <m>i</m>,
      the unfortunately misnamed
          <idx><h>imaginary unit,
      <m>i</m></h></idx><idx><h>complex number </h><h> imaginary unit,
      <m>i</m></h></idx>
      <em>imaginary unit</em>.
      The number <m>i</m>, while not a real number,
      is defined so that it plays along well with real numbers and acts very much like any other radical expression.
      For instance, <m>3(2i) = 6i</m>,
      <m>7i-3i = 4i</m>, <m>(2-7i) + (3 + 4i) = 5-3i</m>, and so forth.
      The key properties which distinguish <m>i</m> from the real numbers are listed below.

        Historically,
        the lack of solutions to the equation <m>x^2=-1</m> had nothing to do with the development of the complex numbers.
        Until the 19th century,
        equations such as <m>x^2=-1</m> would have been considered in the context of the analytic geometry of Descartes.
        The lack of solutions simply indicated that the graph <m>y=x^2</m> did not intersect the line <m>y=-1</m>.
        The more remarkable case was that of
        <em>cubic</em> equations,
        of the form <m>x^3=ax+b</m>.
        In this case a <em>real</em>
        solution is <em>guaranteed</em>,
        but there are cases where one needs
        <em>complex</em> numbers to find it!
        For details,
        see the excellent book <em>Visual Complex Analysis</em>,
        by Tristan Needham.

      <title>The imaginary unit</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The imaginary unit <m>i</m> satisfies the two following properties:

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>i^2 = -1</m>
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>c</m> is a real number with
                <m>c \geq 0</m> then <m>\sqrt{-c} = i \sqrt{c}</m>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <aside>
      <p>
        Note the use of the indefinite article <q>a</q>
        in <xref ref="idefn">Definition</xref>.
        Whatever beast is chosen to be <m>i</m>,
        <m>-i</m> is the other square root of <m>-1</m>.
      </p>
    </aside>
    <aside>
      <p>
        Some Technical Mathematics textbooks label the imaginary unit <q><m>j</m></q>,
        usually to avoid confusion with the use of the letter <m>i</m> to denote electric current.
        While it carries the adjective <q>imaginary</q>,
        these numbers have essential real-world implications.
        For example,
        every electronic device owes its existence to the study of
        <q>imaginary</q> numbers.
      </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      Property 1 in <xref ref="idefn">Definition</xref>
      establishes that <m>i</m> does act as a square root of <m>-1</m>,
      and property 2 establishes what we mean by the
      <q>principal square root</q> of a negative real number.
      In property 2, it is important to remember the restriction on <m>c</m>.
      For example,
      it is perfectly acceptable to say <m>\sqrt{-4} = i \sqrt{4} = i(2) = 2i</m>.
      However, <m>\sqrt{-(-4)} \neq i \sqrt{-4}</m>, otherwise, we'd get
      <me>
        2 = \sqrt{4} = \sqrt{-(-4)} = i \sqrt{-4} = i (2i) = 2i^2 = 2(-1) = -2
      </me>,
      which is unacceptable.
      The moral of this story is that the general properties of radicals do not apply for even roots of negative quantities.
      With <xref ref="idefn">Definition</xref> in place,
      we are now in position to define the
          <idx><h>complex number </h><h> definition of</h></idx>
      <em>complex numbers</em>.

          A <term>complex number</term>
          is a number of the form <m>a+bi</m>,
          where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are real numbers and <m>i</m> is the imaginary unit.

      Complex numbers include things you'd normally expect,
      like <m>3+2i</m> and <m>\frac{2}{5} - i\sqrt{3}</m>.
      However, don't forget that <m>a</m> or <m>b</m> could be zero,
      which means numbers like <m>3i</m> and <m>6</m> are also complex numbers.
      In other words, don't forget that the complex numbers
      <em>include</em> the real numbers,
      so <m>0</m> and <m>\pi - \sqrt{21}</m> are both considered complex numbers.
      The arithmetic of complex numbers is as you would expect.
      The only things you need to remember are the two properties in <xref ref="idefn">Definition</xref>.
      The next example should help recall how these animals behave.

                As mentioned earlier,
                we treat expressions involving <m>i</m> as we would any other radical.
                We distribute and combine like terms:
                <md>
                  <mrow>(1-2i) - (3+4i) \amp  =   1-2i-3-4i  \tag{Distribute}</mrow>
                  <mrow>\amp  =   -2 - 6i  \tag{Gather like terms}</mrow>
                </md>
                Technically,
                we'd have to rewrite our answer  <m>-2-6i</m> as <m>(-2) + (-6)i</m> to be
                (in the strictest sense)
                <q>in the form <m>a+bi</m></q>.
                That being said, even pedants have their limits,
                and we'll consider <m>-2-6i</m> good enough.

    <p>
      In the previous example,
      we used the idea of a <q>conjugate</q>
      to divide two complex numbers. (You may recall using conjugates to rationalize expressions involving square roots.) More generally, the
          <idx><h>complex number </h><h> complex conjugate ! definition of</h></idx><idx><h>conjugate </h><h> complex conjugate ! definition of</h></idx>
      <em>complex conjugate</em>
      of a complex number <m>a+bi</m> is the number <m>a-bi</m>.
      The notation commonly used for complex conjugation is a <q>bar</q>:
      <m>\overline{a+bi} = a-bi</m>.
      For example,
      <m>\overline{3+2i} = 3-2i</m> and <m>\overline{3-2i} = 3+2i</m>.
      To find <m>\overline{6}</m>,
      we note that <m>\overline{6} = \overline{6+0i}= 6 - 0i = 6</m>,
      so <m>\overline{6} = 6</m>.
      Similarly, <m>\overline{4i} = -4i</m>,
      since <m>\overline{4i} = \overline{0 + 4i} = 0 - 4i = -4i</m>.
      Note that <m>\overline{3+\sqrt{5}} = 3 + \sqrt{5}</m>,
      not <m>3 - \sqrt{5}</m>,
      since <m>\overline{3+\sqrt{5}} = \overline{3+\sqrt{5} + 0i} = 3+\sqrt{5} - 0i = 3+\sqrt{5}</m>.
      Here, the conjugation specified by the <q>bar</q>
      notation involves reversing the sign before <m>i = \sqrt{-1}</m>,
      not before <m>\sqrt{5}</m>.
      The properties of the conjugate are summarized in the following theorem.

            </li>
          </ul>

      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      Essentially, <xref ref="conjugateprops">Theorem</xref>
      says that complex conjugation works well with addition,
      multiplication and powers.
      The proofs of these properties can best be achieved by writing out <m>z = a+bi</m> and
      <m>w = c+di</m> for real numbers <m>a</m>,
      <m>b</m>, <m>c</m> and <m>d</m>.
      Next, we compute the left and right sides of each equation and verify that they are the same.
    </p>

    <p>
      The proof of the first property is a very quick exercise.
      To prove the second property,
      we compare <m>\overline{z+w}</m> with <m>\overline{z} + \overline{w}</m>.
      We have <m>\overline{z} + \overline{w} = \overline{a+bi} + \overline{c+di}  = a-bi + c-di</m>.
      To find <m>\overline{z+w}</m>, we first compute
      <me>
        z+w = (a+bi) + (c+di) = (a+c)+(b+d)i
      </me>
      so
      <me>
        \overline{z+w} = \overline{(a+c)+(b+d)i} = (a+c) - (b+d)i = a - bi + c - di = \overline{z} + \overline{w}
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      As such, we have established <m>\overline{z+w} = \overline{z}+\overline{w}</m>.
      The proof for multiplication works similarly.
      The proof that the conjugate works well with powers can be viewed as a repeated application of the product rule,
      and is best proved using a technique called Mathematical Induction.
      The last property is a characterization of real numbers.
      If <m>z</m> is real, then <m>z = a + 0i</m>,
      so <m>\overline{z} = a - 0i = a = z</m>.
      On the other hand, if <m>z=\overline{z}</m>,
      then <m>a+bi = a - bi</m> which means <m>b=-b</m> so <m>b=0</m>.
      Hence, <m>z = a +0i = a</m> and is real.

        We're assuming some prior familiarity on the part of the reader where quadratic equations are concerned.
        If you feel that it would be unfair to tackle quadratic equations with complex solutions before the case of real solutions has been properly addressed,
        you may want to briefly skip ahead to <xref ref="QuadraticFunctions">Section</xref>.
      </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      We now consider the problem of solving quadratic equations.
      Consider <m>x^2-2x+5 = 0</m>.
      The discriminant <m>b^2 - 4ac = -16</m> is negative,
      so we know by <xref ref="discriminanttrichotomy">Theorem</xref>
      there are no <em>real</em> solutions,
      since the Quadratic Formula would involve the term <m>\sqrt{-16}</m>.
      Complex numbers, however, are built just for such situations,
      so we can go ahead and apply the Quadratic Formula to get:
      <me>
        x = \dfrac{-(-2) \pm \sqrt{(-2)^2-4(1)(5)}}{2(1)} = \dfrac{2 \pm \sqrt{-16}}{2} = \dfrac{2 \pm 4i}{2} = 1 \pm 2i

                Clearing fractions yields a quadratic equation so we collect all terms on one side and apply the Quadratic Formula.

                </md>
                From here, we apply the Quadratic Formula
                <md>
                  <mrow>x  \amp  =   \dfrac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4(1)(3)}}{2(1)}   \tag{Quadratic Formula}</mrow>

                </md>
                We get two answers:
                <m>x = -1 + i\sqrt{2}</m> and its conjugate <m>x = -1 - i\sqrt{2}</m>.
                Checking both of these answers reviews all of the salient points about complex number arithmetic and is therefore strongly encouraged.
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                Since we have three terms,
                and the exponent on one term (<q><m>4</m></q>
                on <m>t^4</m>) is exactly twice the exponent on the other (<q><m>2</m></q> on <m>t^2</m>),
                we have a Quadratic in Disguise.
                We proceed accordingly.
                <md>
                  <mrow>2t^4 \amp  =  9t^2 + 5</mrow>
                  <mrow>2t^4 - 9t^2 - 5 \amp  =  0  \tag{Subtract $9t^2$ and $5$}</mrow>

                  <mrow>2t^2 + 1 = 0 \amp   \text{ or }    t^2 = 5  \tag{Zero Product Property}</mrow>
                </md>
                From <m>2t^2 + 1 = 0</m> we get <m>2t^2 = -1</m>,
                or <m>t^2 = -\frac{1}{2}</m>.
                We extract square roots as follows:
                <me>
                  t = \pm \sqrt{-\dfrac{1}{2}} = \pm i \sqrt{\dfrac{1}{2}} = \pm i \dfrac{\sqrt{1}}{\sqrt{2}} = \pm i \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \pm \dfrac{i \sqrt{2}}{2}
                </me>,
                where we have rationalized the denominator per convention.
                From <m>t^2 = 5</m>, we get <m>t = \pm \sqrt{5}</m>.
                In total, we have four complex solutions - two real:
                <m>t = \pm \sqrt{5}</m> and two non-real:
                <m>t = \pm \frac{i \sqrt{2}}{2}</m>.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                To find  the <em>real</em>
                solutions to  <m>z^3 + 1 = 0</m>,
                we can subtract the <m>1</m> from both sides and extract cube roots:
                <m>z^3 = -1</m>, so <m>z  = \sqrt[3]{-1} = -1</m>.
                It turns out there are two more non-real complex number solutions to this equation.
                To get at these, we factor:
                <md>
                  <mrow>z ^ 3 + 1 \amp  =  0</mrow>
                  <mrow>(z + 1)(z^2 - z + 1) \amp  =  0  \tag{Factor (Sum of Two Cubes)}</mrow>
                  <mrow>z + 1 = 0 \amp   \text{ or }    z^2 - z + 1 = 0</mrow>
                </md>
                From <m>z+1 = 0</m>, we get our real solution <m>z = -1</m>.
                From <m>z^2 -z + 1 = 0</m>,
          we apply the Quadratic Formula to get:
                <me>
                  z = \dfrac{-(-1) \pm \sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2(1)} = \dfrac{1 \pm \sqrt{-3}}{2} = \dfrac{1 \pm i\sqrt{3}}{2}
                </me>
                Thus we get <em>three</em>
                solutions to <m>z^3 + 1 = 0</m> - one real:
                <m>z = -1</m> and two non-real:
                <m>z =  \frac{1 \pm i\sqrt{3}}{2}</m>.
                As always,
          the reader is encouraged to test their algebraic mettle and check these solutions.

    <p>
      It is no coincidence that the non-real solutions to the equations in <xref ref="complexsolnsreviewex">Example</xref>
      appear in complex conjugate pairs.
      Any time we use the Quadratic Formula to solve an equation with
      <em>real</em> coefficients,
      the answers will form a complex conjugate pair owing to the <m>\pm</m> in the Quadratic Formula.
      This leads us to a generalization of <xref ref="discriminanttrichotomy">Theorem</xref>
      which we state on the next page.
