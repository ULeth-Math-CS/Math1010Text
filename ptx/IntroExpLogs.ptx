  <title>Introduction to Exponential and Logarithmic Functions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Of all of the functions we study in this text,
      exponential and logarithmic functions are possibly the ones which impact everyday life the most.
      This section introduces us to these functions while the rest of the chapter will more thoroughly explore their properties.
      Up to this point,
      we have dealt with functions which involve terms like <m>x^2</m> or <m>x^{2/3}</m>,
      in other words,
      terms of the form <m>x^{p}</m> where the base of the term, <m>x</m>,
      varies but the exponent of each term,
      <m>p</m>, remains constant.
      In this chapter, we study functions of the form
      <m>f(x) = b^{x}</m> where the base <m>b</m> is a constant and the exponent <m>x</m> is the variable.
      We start our exploration of these functions with
      <m>f(x) = 2^{x}</m>. (Apparently this is a tradition.
      Every textbook we have ever read starts with
      <m>f(x) = 2^{x}</m>.) We make a table of values,
      plot the points and connect the dots in a pleasing fashion:

        Exponential and logarithmic functions frequently occur in solutions to differential equations,
        which are used to produce mathematical models of phenomena throughout the physical,
        life, and social sciences.
        You'll see some examples if you continue on to Calculus I and II, and even more if you take Math 3600,
        our first course in differential equations.

    <p>
      A few remarks about the graph of
      <m>f(x) = 2^{x}</m> which we have constructed are in order.
      As <m>x \rightarrow -\infty</m> and attains values like <m>x = -100</m> or <m>x=-1000</m>,
      the function <m>f(x) = 2^{x}</m> takes on values like
      <m>f(-100) = 2^{-100} = \frac{1}{2^{100}}</m> or <m>f(-1000) = 2^{-1000} = \frac{1}{2^{1000}}</m>.
      In other words, as <m>x \rightarrow -\infty</m>,
      <me>
        2^{x} \approx \frac{1}{\mbox{very big \((+)\)} }  \approx \mbox{very small \((+)\)}
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      So as <m>x \rightarrow -\infty</m>,
      <m>2^{x} \rightarrow 0^{+}</m>.
      This is represented graphically using the <m>x</m>-axis
      (the line <m>y = 0</m>)
      as a horizontal asymptote.
      On the flip side, as <m>x \rightarrow \infty</m>,
      we find <m>f(100) = 2^{100}</m>,
      <m>f(1000) = 2^{1000}</m>, and so on,
      thus <m>2^{x} \rightarrow \infty</m>.
      As a result,
      our graph suggests the range of <m>f</m> is <m>(0,\infty)</m>.
      The graph of <m>f</m> passes the Horizontal Line Test which means <m>f</m> is one-to-one and hence invertible.
      We also note that when we <q>connected the dots in a pleasing fashion</q>,
      we have made the implicit assumption that <m>f(x) = 2^{x}</m> is continuous
      (recall that this means there are no holes or other kinds of breaks in the graph)
      and has a domain of all real numbers.
      In particular, we have suggested that things like
      <m>2^{\sqrt{3}}</m> exist as real numbers.
      We should take a moment to discuss what something like <m>2^{\sqrt{3}}</m> might mean,
      and refer the interested reader to a solid course in Calculus for a more rigorous explanation.
      The number <m>\sqrt{3} = 1.73205 \ldots</m> is an irrational number and as such,
      its decimal representation neither repeats nor terminates.
      We can, however, approximate
      <m>\sqrt{3}</m> by terminating decimals, and it stands to reason
      (this is where Calculus and continuity come into play)
      that we can use these to approximate <m>2^{\sqrt{3}}</m>.
      For example, if we approximate <m>\sqrt{3}</m> by <m>1.73</m>,
      we can approximate <m>2^{\sqrt{3}} \approx 2^{1.73} = 2^{\frac{173}{100}} = \sqrt[100]{2^{173}}</m>.
      It is not, by any means, a pleasant number,
      but it is at least a number that we understand in terms of powers and roots.
      It also stands to reason that better and better approximations of
      <m>\sqrt{3}</m> yield better and better approximations of <m>2^{\sqrt{3}}</m>,
      so the value of <m>2^{\sqrt{3}}</m> should be the result of this sequence of approximations.
    </p>

    <aside>
      <p>
        You (yes, you) can actually prove that
        <m>\sqrt{3}</m> is irrational by considering the polynomial
        <m>p(x) = x^2-3</m> and showing it has no rational zeros by applying <xref ref="RZT">Theorem</xref>.

      <p>
        To fully understand the argument we used to define <m>2^x</m> when <m>x</m> is irrational,
        you'll have to proceed far enough through the Calculus sequence (Calculus III should do it) to encounter the topic of convergence of infinite sequences.

      Suppose we wish to study the family of functions <m>f(x) = b^{x}</m>.
      Which bases <m>b</m> make sense to study?
      We find that we run into difficulty if <m>b \lt 0</m>.
      For example, if <m>b = -2</m>,
      then the function <m>f(x) = (-2)^{x}</m> has trouble,
      for instance,
      at <m>x = \frac{1}{2}</m> since
      <m>(-2)^{1/2} = \sqrt{-2}</m> is not a real number.
      In general,
      if <m>x</m> is any rational number with an even denominator,
      then <m>(-2)^{x}</m> is not defined,
      so we must restrict our attention to bases <m>b \geq 0</m>.
      What about <m>b = 0</m>?
      The function <m>f(x) = 0^{x}</m> is undefined for
      <m>x \leq 0</m> because we cannot divide by <m>0</m> and <m>0^{0}</m> is an indeterminant form.
      For <m>x > 0</m>, <m>0^{x} = 0</m> so the function
      <m>f(x) = 0^{x}</m> is the same as the function <m>f(x) = 0</m>,
      <m>x > 0</m>. \phantomsection We know everything we can possibly know about this function,
      so we exclude it from our investigations.
      The only other base we exclude is <m>b=1</m>,
      since the function <m>f(x) = 1^{x} = 1</m> is, once again,
      a function we have already studied.
      We are now ready for our definition of exponential functions.

      We leave it to the reader to verify
      (by graphing some more examples on your own)
      that if <m>b > 1</m>, then the exponential function
      <m>f(x) = b^{x}</m> will share the same basic shape and characteristics as <m>f(x) = 2^{x}</m>.
      What if <m>0 \lt b \lt 1</m>?
      Consider <m>g(x) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{x}</m>.
      We could certainly build a table of values and connect the points,
      or we could take a step back and note that <m>g(x) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{x} = \left(2^{-1}\right)^{x} = 2^{-x} = f(-x)</m>,
      where <m>f(x) = 2^{x}</m>.
      Thinking back to <xref ref="Transformations">Section</xref>,
      the graph of <m>f(-x)</m> is obtained from the graph of <m>f(x)</m> by reflecting it across the <m>y</m>-axis.
      We get the graph in <xref ref="fig_introexp2">Figure</xref> (b).

    <p>
      We see that the domain and range of <m>g</m> match that of <m>f</m>,
      namely <m>(-\infty, \infty)</m> and <m>(0,\infty)</m>,
      respectively.
      Like <m>f</m>, <m>g</m> is also one-to-one.
      Whereas <m>f</m> is always increasing,
      <m>g</m> is always decreasing.
      As a result, as <m>x \rightarrow -\infty</m>,
      <m>g(x) \rightarrow \infty</m>, and on the flip side,
      as <m>x \rightarrow \infty</m>,
      <m>g(x) \rightarrow 0^{+}</m>.
      It shouldn't be too surprising that for all choices of the base <m>0 \lt b \lt 1</m>,
      the graph of <m>y=b^{x}</m> behaves similarly to the graph of <m>g</m>.
      We summarize the basic properties of exponential functions in the following theorem. (The proof of which,
      like many things discussed in the text, requires Calculus.)

    <p>
      Of all of the bases for exponential functions,
      two occur the most often in scientific circles.
      The first, base <m>10</m>, is often called the
          <idx><h>exponential function</h><h>common base</h></idx><idx><h>common base</h></idx>
      <em>common base</em>.
      The second base is an irrational number,
      <m>e \approx 2.718</m>, called the
          <idx><h>natural base</h></idx><idx><h>exponential function</h><h>natural base</h></idx>
      <em>natural base</em>.
      You may encounter a more formal discussion of the number <m>e</m> in later Calculus courses.
      For now, it is enough to know that since <m>e > 1</m>,
      <m>f(x) = e^{x}</m> is an increasing exponential function.
      The following examples give us an idea how these functions are used in the wild.

                To graph <m>y=25\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^{x}</m>,
                we start with the basic exponential function <m>f(x)=\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^{x}</m>.
                Since the base <m>b = \frac{4}{5}</m> is between <m>0</m> and <m>1</m>,
                the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> is decreasing.
                We plot the <m>y</m>-intercept <m>(0,1)</m> and two other points,
                <m>\left(-1, \frac{5}{4}\right)</m> and <m>\left(1, \frac{4}{5}\right)</m>,
                and label the horizontal asymptote <m>y=0</m>.

                <m>x \geq 0</m>,
                we multiply the output from <m>f</m> by <m>25</m>,
                in other words, <m>V(x) = 25 f(x)</m>.
                In accordance with <xref ref="vscalings">Theorem</xref>,
                this results in a vertical stretch by a factor of <m>25</m>.
                We multiply all of the <m>y</m> values in the graph by <m>25</m>
                (including the <m>y</m> value of the horizontal asymptote)

                <m>(0,25)</m> and <m>(1,20)</m>.
                The horizontal asymptote remains <m>y=0</m>.
                Finally, we restrict the domain to

      The function in the previous example is often called a <q>decay curve</q>.
      Increasing exponential functions are used to model <q>growth curves</q>
      many examples of which are encountered in applications of exponential functions.
      For now, we present another common decay curve which will serve as the basis for further study of exponential functions.
      Although it may look more complicated than the previous example,
      it is actually just a basic exponential function which has been modified by a few transformations from <xref ref="Transformations">Section</xref>.

                To graph <m>y = T(t)</m> using transformations,
                we start with the basic function, <m>f(t)=e^{t}</m>.
                As we have already remarked,
                <m>e \approx 2.718 > 1</m> so the graph of <m>f</m> is an increasing exponential with <m>y</m>-intercept <m>(0,1)</m> and horizontal asymptote <m>y = 0</m>.
                The points <m>\left(-1, e^{-1}\right) \approx (-1,0.37)</m> and
                <m>(1,e) \approx (1,2.72)</m> are also on the graph.
                Since the formula <m>T(t)</m> looks rather complicated,
                we rewrite <m>T(t)</m> in the form presented in <xref ref="transformationsthm">Theorem</xref>
                and use that result to track the changes to our three points and the horizontal asymptote.
                We have
                <me>
                  T(t) = 70 + 90e^{-0.1t} = 90e^{-0.1t}+70 = 90 f(-0.1t)+70
                </me>
                Multiplication of the input to <m>f</m>, <m>t</m>,
                by <m>-0.1</m> results in a horizontal expansion by a factor of <m>10</m> as well as a reflection about the <m>y</m>-axis.
                We divide each of the <m>x</m> values of our points by <m>-0.1</m>
                (which amounts to multiplying them by <m>-10</m>)
                to obtain <m>\left(10,e^{-1}\right)</m>, <m>(0,1)</m>,
                and <m>\left(-10, e\right)</m>.
                Since none of these changes affected the <m>y</m> values,
                the horizontal asymptote remains <m>y = 0</m>.
                Next,
          we see that the output from <m>f</m> is being multiplied by <m>90</m>.
                This results in a vertical stretch by a factor of <m>90</m>.
                We multiply the <m>y</m>-coordinates by <m>90</m> to obtain <m>\left(10,90e^{-1}\right)</m>,
                <m>(0,90)</m>,
                and <m>\left(-10, 90e\right)</m>.
                We also multiply the <m>y</m> value of the horizontal asymptote <m>y=0</m> by <m>90</m>,
                and it remains <m>y=0</m>.
                Finally,
          we add <m>70</m> to all of the <m>y</m>-coordinates,
                which shifts the graph upwards to obtain <m>\left(10,90e^{-1} + 70\right) \approx (10, 103.11)</m>,
                <m>(0,160)</m>,
                and <m>\left(-10, 90e+ 70\right) \approx (-10,314.64)</m>.
                Adding <m>70</m> to the horizontal asymptote shifts it upwards as well to <m>y=70</m>.
                We connect these three points using the same shape in the same direction as in the graph of <m>f</m> and,
                last but not least,
                we restrict the domain to match the applied domain <m>[0, \infty)</m>.

                From the graph,
                we see that the horizontal asymptote is <m>y = 70</m>.
                It is worth a moment or two of our time to see how this happens analytically and to review some of the <q>number sense</q>
                developed in <xref ref="Rationals">Chapter</xref>.
                As <m>t \rightarrow \infty</m>, We get <m>T(t) = 70+90e^{-0.1t} \approx 70 +90e^{\text{ very big \((-)\) } }</m>.
                Since <m>e > 1</m>,
                <me>
                  e^{\text{ very big \((-)\) } } = \frac{1}{e^{\text{ very big \((+)\) } }} \approx \frac{1}{\text{ very big \((+)\) } } \approx \text{ very small \((+)\) }
                </me>
                The larger <m>t</m> becomes,
                the smaller <m>e^{-0.1t}</m> becomes,
                so the term <m>90 e^{-0.1t} \approx \text{ very small \((+)\) }</m>.
                Hence,
          <m>T(t) \approx 70 + \text{ very small \((+)\) }</m> which means the graph is approaching the horizontal line <m>y=70</m> from above.
                This means that as time goes by,
                the temperature of the coffee is cooling to <m>70^{\circ}\mbox{F}</m>,

        The reader is cautioned that in more advanced mathematics textbooks,
        the notation <m>\log(x)</m> is often used to denote the natural logarithm (or its generalization to the complex numbers).
        In mathematics,
        the natural logarithm is preferred since it is better behaved with respect to the operations of Calculus.
        The base 10 logarithm tends to appear in other science fields.
      </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      Since logs are defined as the inverses of exponential functions,
      we can use <xref ref="inversefunctionprops">Theorems</xref>
      and <xref ref="inverseuniquegraph"></xref>
      to tell us about logarithmic functions.
      For example,
      we know that the domain of a log function is the range of an exponential function,
      namely <m>(0, \infty)</m>,
      and that the range of a log function is the domain of an exponential function,
      namely <m>(-\infty, \infty)</m>.
      Since we know the basic shapes of
      <m>y = f(x) = b^{x}</m> for the different cases of <m>b</m>,
      we can obtain the graph of
      <m>y = f^{-1}(x) = \log_{b}(x)</m> by reflecting the graph of <m>f</m> across the line <m>y=x</m> as shown below.
      The <m>y</m>-intercept <m>(0,1)</m> on the graph of <m>f</m> corresponds to an <m>x</m>-intercept of <m>(1,0)</m> on the graph of <m>f^{-1}</m>.
      The horizontal asymptotes <m>y=0</m> on the graphs of the exponential functions become vertical asymptotes <m>x=0</m> on the log graphs:
      see <xref ref="fig_introexp5">Figure</xref>.

      On a procedural level, logs undo the exponentials.
      Consider the function <m>f(x) = 2^{x}</m>.
      When we evaluate <m>f(3) = 2^{3} = 8</m>,
      the input <m>3</m> becomes the exponent on the base <m>2</m> to produce the real number <m>8</m>.
      The function <m>f^{-1}(x) = \log_{2}(x)</m> then takes the number <m>8</m> as its input and returns the exponent <m>3</m> as its output.
      In symbols, <m>\log_{2}(8) = 3</m>.
      More generally,
      <m>\log_{2}(x)</m> is the exponent you put on <m>2</m> to get <m>x</m>.
      Thus, <m>\log_{2}(16) = 4</m>,
      because <m>2^{4} = 16</m>.
      The following theorem summarizes the basic properties of logarithmic functions,
      all of which come from the fact that they are inverses of exponential functions.

    <p>
      As we have mentioned, <xref ref="logfcnprops">Theorem</xref>
      is a consequence of <xref ref="inversefunctionprops">Theorems</xref>
      and <xref ref="inverseuniquegraph"></xref>.
      However, it is worth the reader's time to understand <xref ref="logfcnprops">Theorem</xref>
      from an exponential perspective.
      For instance, we know that the domain of
      <m>g(x) = \log_{2}(x)</m> is <m>(0,\infty)</m>.
      Why?
      Because the range of <m>f(x) = 2^{x}</m> is <m>(0,\infty)</m>.
      In a way, this says everything,
      but at the same time, it doesn't.
      For example, if we try to find <m>\log_{2}(-1)</m>,
      we are trying to find the exponent we put on <m>2</m> to give us <m>-1</m>.
      In other words,
      we are looking for <m>x</m> that satisfies <m>2^{x} = -1</m>.
      There is no such real number,
      since all powers of <m>2</m> are positive.
      While what we have said is exactly the same thing as saying
      <q>the domain of <m>g(x) = \log_{2}(x)</m> is <m>(0,\infty)</m> because the range of
      <m>f(x) = 2^{x}</m> is <m>(0,\infty)</m></q>,
      we feel it is in a student's best interest to understand the statements in <xref ref="logfcnprops">Theorem</xref>
      at this level instead of just merely memorizing the facts.

                The number <m>\log_{3}(81)</m> is the exponent we put on <m>3</m> to get <m>81</m>.
                As such, we want to write <m>81</m> as a power of <m>3</m>.
                We find <m>81 = 3^{4}</m>,
          so that <m>\log_{3}(81)=4</m>.

                To find <m>\log_{2}\left(\frac{1}{8}\right)</m>,
                we need rewrite <m>\frac{1}{8}</m> as a power of <m>2</m>.
                We find <m>\frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{2^{3}} = 2^{-3}</m>,
                so <m>\log_{2}\left(\frac{1}{8}\right) = -3</m>.
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                To determine <m>\log_{\sqrt{5}}(25)</m>,
                we need to express <m>25</m> as a power of <m>\sqrt{5}</m>.
                We know <m>25 = 5^2</m>,
          and <m>5 = \left(\sqrt{5}\right)^2</m>,
                so we have <m>25 = \left(\left(\sqrt{5}\right)^2\right)^2 = \left(\sqrt{5}\right)^4</m>.
                We get <m>\log_{\sqrt{5}}(25) = 4</m>.

            <li>
              <p>
                First, recall that the notation
                <m>\ln\left(\sqrt[3]{e^2}\right)</m> means <m>\log_{e}\left(\sqrt[3]{e^2}\right)</m>,
                so we are looking for the exponent to put on <m>e</m> to obtain <m>\sqrt[3]{e^2}</m>.
                Rewriting <m>\sqrt[3]{e^2} = e^{2/3}</m>,
                we find <m>\ln\left(\sqrt[3]{e^2}\right) = \ln\left(e^{2/3}\right) = \frac{2}{3}</m>.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Rewriting <m>\log(0.001)</m> as <m>\log_{10} (0.001)</m>,
                we see that we need to write <m>0.001</m> as a power of <m>10</m>.
                We have <m>0.001 = \frac{1}{1000} = \frac{1}{10^3} = 10^{-3}</m>.
                Hence,
          <m>\log(0.001) = \log\left(10^{-3}\right) = -3</m>.
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                We can use <xref ref="logfcnprops">Theorem</xref>
                directly to simplify <m>2^{\log_{2}(8)} = 8</m>.
                We can also understand this problem by first finding <m>\log_{2}(8)</m>.
                By definition,
                <m>\log_{2}(8)</m> is the exponent we put on <m>2</m> to get <m>8</m>.
                Since <m>8 = 2^3</m>, we have <m>\log_{2}(8) = 3</m>.
                We now substitute to find <m>2^{\log_{2}(8)} = 2^3 = 8</m>.

                we know <m>117^{\log_{117}(6)}=6</m>,
                but we cannot directly apply this formula to the expression
                <m>117^{-\log_{117}(6)}</m>.  (Can you see why?) At this point,
                we use a property of exponents followed by <xref ref="logfcnprops">Theorem</xref> to get
                <me>
                  117^{-\log_{117}(6)} = \frac{1}{117^{\log_{117}(6)}} = \frac{1}{6}

                    It is worth a moment of your time to think your way through why <m>117^{\log_{117}(6)}=6</m>.
                    By definition,
                    <m>\log_{117}(6)</m> is the exponent we put on <m>117</m> to get <m>6</m>.
                    What are we doing with this exponent?
                    We are putting it on <m>117</m>.
                    By definition we get <m>6</m>.
                    In other words, the exponential function
                    <m>f(x) = 117^{x}</m> undoes the logarithmic function <m>g(x) = \log_{117}(x)</m>.

      Up until this point,
      restrictions on the domains of functions came from avoiding division by zero and keeping negative numbers from beneath even radicals.
      With the introduction of logs,
      we now have another restriction.
      Since the domain of <m>f(x) = \log_{b}(x)</m> is <m>(0, \infty)</m>,
      the argument of the log must be strictly positive.

                We set <m>3-x > 0</m> to obtain <m>x\lt 3</m>, or <m>(-\infty, 3)</m>.
                The graph in <xref ref="fig_introexp6">Figure</xref> verifies this.
                Note that we could have graphed <m>f</m> using transformations.
                Taking a cue from <xref ref="transformationsthm">Theorem</xref>,
                we rewrite <m>f(x) = 2 \log_{10}(-x+3) -1</m> and find the main function involved is <m>y = h(x) = \log_{10}(x)</m>.
                We select three points to track,
                <m>\left(\frac{1}{10}, -1\right)</m>,
                <m>(1,0)</m> and <m>(10,1)</m>,
                along with the vertical asymptote <m>x=0</m>.
                Since <m>f(x) = 2h(-x+3)-1</m>,
                <xref ref="transformationsthm">Theorem</xref>
                tells us that to obtain the destinations of these points,
                we first subtract <m>3</m> from the <m>x</m>-coordinates
                (shifting the graph left <m>3</m> units),
                then divide (multiply) by the <m>x</m>-coordinates by <m>-1</m> (causing a reflection across the <m>y</m>-axis).
                These transformations apply to the vertical asymptote <m>x = 0</m> as well.
                Subtracting <m>3</m> gives us <m>x=-3</m> as our asymptote,
                then multiplying by <m>-1</m> gives us the vertical asymptote <m>x=3</m>.
                Next,
          we multiply the <m>y</m>-coordinates by <m>2</m> which results in a vertical stretch by a factor of <m>2</m>,
                then we finish by subtracting <m>1</m> from the <m>y</m>-coordinates which shifts the graph down <m>1</m> unit.
                We leave it to the reader to perform the indicated arithmetic on the points themselves and to verify the graph produced by the calculator below. <figure xml:id="fig_introexp6"> <caption><m>y=f(x)=2\log(3-x)-1</m></caption> <img src="figures/ExpLogsGraphics/ExpLogs01.pdf"/> </figure>

                To find the domain of <m>g</m>,
                we need to solve the inequality <m>\frac{x}{x-1} > 0</m>.
                As usual, we proceed using a sign diagram.
                If we define <m>r(x) = \dfrac{x}{x-1}</m>,
                we find <m>r</m> is undefined at <m>x=1</m> and <m>r(x) = 0</m> when <m>x=0</m>.

                we generate the sign diagram in <xref ref="fig_introexpsd1">Figure</xref>. <figure xml:id="fig_introexpsd1"> <caption>Sign diagram for
                <m>r(x) = \frac{x}{x-1}</m></caption> <img src="figures/ExpLogsGraphics/IntroExpLogs-14.pdf"/> </figure> We find <m>\frac{x}{x-1} > 0</m> on
                <m>(-\infty, 0) \cup (1, \infty)</m> to get the domain of <m>g</m>.
                The graph of <m>y=g(x)</m> in <xref ref="fig_introexp7">Figure</xref> confirms this.
                We can tell from the graph of <m>g</m> that it is not the result of <xref ref="Transformations">Section</xref>
                transformations being applied to the graph <m>y = \ln(x)</m>,
                so barring a more detailed analysis using Calculus,
                the calculator graph is the best we can do.
                One thing worthy of note, however,
                is the end behaviour of <m>g</m>.
                The graph suggests that as <m>x \rightarrow \pm \infty</m>,
                <m>g(x) \rightarrow 0</m>.
                We can verify this analytically.
                Using results from <xref ref="Rationals">Chapter</xref> and continuity,
                we know that as <m>x \rightarrow \pm \infty</m>,
                <m>\frac{x}{x-1} \approx 1</m>.
                Hence, it makes sense that
                <m>g(x) = \ln \left(\frac{x}{x-1}\right) \approx \ln(1) = 0</m>. <figure xml:id="fig_introexp7"> <caption><m>y=g(x)=\ln\left(\frac{x}{x-1}\right)</m></caption> <img src="figures/ExpLogsGraphics/ExpLogs02.pdf"/> </figure>

      While logarithms have some interesting applications of their own which you'll explore in the exercises,
      their primary use to us will be to undo exponential functions. (This is,
      after all,
      how they were defined.) Our last example solidifies this and reviews all of the material in the section.

                If we identify <m>g(x) = 2^{x}</m>,
                we see <m>f(x) = g(x-1)-3</m>.
                We pick the points <m>\left(-1, \frac{1}{2}\right)</m>,
                <m>(0,1)</m> and <m>(1, 2)</m> on the graph of <m>g</m> along with the horizontal asymptote <m>y=0</m> to track through the transformations.
                By <xref ref="transformationsthm">Theorem</xref>
                we first add <m>1</m> to the <m>x</m>-coordinates of the points on the graph of <m>g</m>
                (shifting <m>g</m> to the right <m>1</m> unit)
                to get <m>\left(0, \frac{1}{2}\right)</m>,
                <m>(1,1)</m> and <m>(2, 2)</m>.
                The horizontal asymptote remains <m>y=0</m>.
                Next,
          we subtract <m>3</m> from the <m>y</m>-coordinates,
                shifting the graph down <m>3</m> units.
                We get the points <m>\left(0, -\frac{5}{2}\right)</m>,

                Connecting the dots in the order and manner as they were on the graph of <m>g</m>,
                we get the bottom graph in <xref ref="fig_introexp8">Figure</xref>.
                We see that the domain of <m>f</m> is the same as <m>g</m>,
                namely <m>(-\infty, \infty)</m>,
                but that the range of <m>f</m> is

            <li>
              <p>
                The graph of <m>f</m> passes the Horizontal Line Test so <m>f</m> is one-to-one,
                hence invertible.
                To find a formula for <m>f^{-1}(x)</m>,
                we normally set <m>y=f(x)</m>,
                interchange the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>,
                then proceed to solve for <m>y</m>.
                Doing so in this situation leads us to the equation <m>x = 2^{y-1}-3</m>.
                We have yet to discuss how to solve this kind of equation,
                so we will attempt to find the formula for <m>f^{-1}</m> from a procedural perspective.
                If we break <m>f(x) = 2^{x-1}-3</m> into a series of steps,
                we find <m>f</m> takes an input <m>x</m> and applies the steps

                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      subtract <m>1</m>
                    </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>
                      put as an exponent on <m>2</m>
                    </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>
                      subtract <m>3</m>
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </p>

              Clearly,
          to undo subtracting <m>1</m>, we will add <m>1</m>,
          and similarly we undo subtracting <m>3</m> by adding <m>3</m>.
          How do we undo the second step?
          The answer is we use the logarithm.
          By definition,
          <m>\log_{2}(x)</m> undoes exponentiation by <m>2</m>.
          Hence, <m>f^{-1}</m> should

              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    add <m>3</m>
                  </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    take the logarithm base <m>2</m>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    add <m>1</m>

                </li>
              </ol>

              In symbols, <m>f^{-1}(x) = \log_{2}(x+3)+1</m>.</li>

            <li>
              <p>
                To graph <m>f^{-1}(x) = \log_{2}(x+3)+1</m> using transformations,
                we start with <m>j(x) = \log_{2}(x)</m>.
                We track the points <m>\left(\frac{1}{2},-1\right)</m>,
                <m>(1,0)</m> and <m>(2, 1)</m> on the graph of <m>j</m> along with the vertical asymptote <m>x=0</m> through the transformations using <xref ref="transformationsthm">Theorem</xref>.
                Since <m>f^{-1}(x) = j(x+3)+1</m>,
                we first subtract <m>3</m> from each of the <m>x</m> values
                (including the vertical asymptote)
                to obtain <m>\left(-\frac{5}{2},-1\right)</m>,
                <m>(-2,0)</m> and <m>(-1, 1)</m> with a vertical asymptote <m>x = -3</m>.
                Next,
          we add <m>1</m> to the <m>y</m> values on the graph and get <m>\left(-\frac{5}{2},0\right)</m>,
                <m>(-2,1)</m> and <m>(-1, 2)</m>.

      (Logarithmic Scales) In the following exercises,
      we introduce three widely used measurement scales which involve common logarithms:
      the Richter scale, the decibel scale and the pH scale.
      The computations involved in all three scales are nearly identical so pay attention to the subtle differences.

          Earthquakes are complicated events and it is not our intent to provide a complete discussion of the science involved in them.
          Instead, we refer the interested reader to a solid course in Geology<fn>Rock-solid,
          perhaps?</fn>or the U.S. Geological Survey's Earthquake Hazards Program found <url href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/"><em>here</em></url> and present only a simplified version of the <url href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_scale"><em>Richter scale</em></url>.
          The Richter scale measures the magnitude of an earthquake by comparing the amplitude of the seismic waves of the given earthquake to those of a
          <q>magnitude 0 event</q>,
          which was chosen to be a seismograph reading of <m>0.001</m> millimetres recorded on a seismometer 100 kilometres from the earthquake's epicentre.
          Specifically, the magnitude of an earthquake is given by
          <me>
            M(x) = \log \left(\dfrac{x}{0.001}\right)
          </me>
          where <m>x</m> is the seismograph reading in millimetres of the earthquake recorded 100 kilometres from the epicentre.

              <idx><h>decibel</h></idx> <idx><h>sound intensity level</h><h>decibel</h></idx>
          While the decibel scale can be used in many disciplines,<fn>See this  <url href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel"><em>webpage</em></url> for more information.</fn>we shall restrict our attention to its use in acoustics,
          specifically its use in measuring the intensity level of sound.<fn>As of the writing of this exercise,
          the Wikipedia page given <url href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_intensity_level"><em>here</em></url> states that it may not meet the
          <q>general notability guideline</q>
          nor does it cite any references or sources.
          I find this odd because it is this very usage of the decibel scale which shows up in every College Algebra book I have read.
          Perhaps those other books have been wrong all along and we're just blindly following tradition.</fn>The Sound Intensity Level <m>L</m>
          (measured in decibels)
          of a sound intensity <m>I</m>
          (measured in watts per square meter)
          is given by
          <me>
            L(I) = 10\log\left( \dfrac{I}{10^{-12}} \right)
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Like the Richter scale, this scale compares <m>I</m> to baseline:
          <m>10^{-12} \frac{W}{m^{2}}</m> is the threshold of human hearing.

          <ol>

                Compute <m>L(10^{-6})</m>.

            <li>
              <p>
                Damage to your hearing can start with short term exposure to sound levels around 115 decibels.
                What intensity <m>I</m> is needed to produce this level?
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>

                How does this compare with the threshold of pain which is around 140 decibels?

          The pH of a solution is a measure of its acidity or alkalinity.
          Specifically, <m>\mbox{pH}  = -\log[\mbox{H} ^{+}]</m> where
          <m>[\mbox{H} ^{+}]</m> is the hydrogen ion concentration in moles per litre.
          A solution with a pH less than 7 is an acid,
          one with a pH greater than 7 is a base (alkaline) and a pH of 7 is regarded as neutral.
