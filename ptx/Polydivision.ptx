  <title>The Factor Theorem and the Remainder Theorem</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Suppose we wish to find the zeros of <m>f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2-5x-14</m>.
      Setting <m>f(x)=0</m> results in the polynomial equation <m>x^3 + 4x^2-5x-14=0</m>.
      Despite all of the factoring techniques we learned
      (and probably forgot)
      in high school, this equation foils us at every turn.
      If we graph <m>f</m> using GeoGebra,
      we get the result in <xref ref="fig_polyzeros1">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="fig_polyzeros1">
      <caption>The graph <m>y=x^3+4x^2-5x-14</m></caption>
      <image source="figures/PolynomialsGraphics/CubicIrrRootZeros"></image>
    </figure>

    <p>
      The graph suggests that the function has three zeros,
      one of which is <m>x=2</m>.
      It's easy to show that <m>f(2) = 0</m>,
      but the other two zeros seem to be less friendly.
      Asking GeoGebra to intersect the graph with the <m>x</m>-axis gives us the decimal approximations shown in the figure,
      but we seek a method to find the remaining zeros <em>exactly</em>.
      Based on our experience, if <m>x=2</m> is a zero,
      it seems that there should be a factor of <m>(x-2)</m> lurking around in the factorization of <m>f(x)</m>.
      In other words,
      we should expect that <m>x^3 + 4x^2-5x-14=(x-2) \, q(x)</m>,
      where <m>q(x)</m> is some other polynomial.
      How could we find such a <m>q(x)</m>, if it even exists?
      The answer comes from our old friend, polynomial division.
      Dividing <m>x^3 + 4x^2-5x-14</m> by <m>x-2</m> gives

      As you may recall,
      this means <m>x^3 + 4x^2-5x-14=(x-2)\left(x^2+6x+7\right)</m>,
      so to find the zeros of <m>f</m>,
      we now solve <m>(x-2)\left(x^2+6x+7\right)=0</m>.
      We get <m>x-2=0</m>
      (which gives us our known zero, <m>x=2</m>)
      as well as <m>x^2+6x+7=0</m>.
      The latter doesn't factor nicely,
      so we apply the Quadratic Formula to get <m>x = -3 \pm \sqrt{2}</m>.
      The point of this section is to generalize the technique applied here.
      First up is a friendly reminder of what we can expect when we divide polynomials.

          There exist two unique polynomials,

      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      As you may recall,
      all of the polynomials in <xref ref="polydiv">Theorem</xref> have special names.
      The polynomial <m>p</m> is called the
          <idx><h>polynomial division</h><h>dividend</h></idx> <em>dividend</em>;

          <idx><h>polynomial division</h><h>factor</h></idx>
      <em>factor</em> of <m>p</m>.
      The proof of <xref ref="polydiv">Theorem</xref>
      is usually relegated to a course in Abstract Algebra,
      but we can still use the result to establish two important facts which are the basis of the rest of the chapter.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="remainderthm">
      <title>The Remainder Theorem</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
              <idx><h>Remainder Theorem</h></idx>
          Suppose <m>p</m> is a polynomial of degree at least <m>1</m> and <m>c</m> is a real number.
          When <m>p(x)</m> is divided by <m>x-c</m> the remainder is <m>p(c)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      The proof of <xref ref="remainderthm">Theorem</xref>
      is a direct consequence of <xref ref="polydiv">Theorem</xref>.
      When a polynomial is divided by <m>x-c</m>,
      the remainder is either <m>0</m> or has degree less than the degree of <m>x-c</m>.
      Since <m>x-c</m> is degree <m>1</m>,
      the degree of the remainder must be <m>0</m>,
      which means the remainder is a constant.
      Hence, in either case, <m>p(x) = (x-c) \, q(x) + r</m>,
      where <m>r</m>,
      the remainder, is a real number, possibly <m>0</m>.
      It follows that <m>p(c) = (c-c) \, q(c) + r = 0 \cdot q(c) + r = r</m>,
      so we get <m>r = p(c)</m> as required.
      There is one more piece of <q>low hanging fruit</q>
      to collect, which we present below.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="factorthm">
      <title>The Factor Theorem</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
              <idx><h>Factor Theorem</h></idx>
          Suppose <m>p</m> is a nonzero polynomial.
          The real number <m>c</m> is a zero of <m>p</m> if and only if <m>(x-c)</m> is a factor of <m>p(x)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      The proof of The Factor Theorem is a consequence of what we already know.
      If <m>(x-c)</m> is a factor of <m>p(x)</m>,
      this means <m>p(x) = (x-c) \, q(x)</m> for some polynomial <m>q</m>.
      Hence, <m>p(c) = (c-c) \, q(c) = 0</m>,
      so <m>c</m> is a zero of <m>p</m>.
      Conversely,
      if <m>c</m> is a zero of <m>p</m>, then <m>p(c) = 0</m>.
      In this case, The Remainder Theorem tells us the remainder when <m>p(x)</m> is divided by <m>(x-c)</m>,
      namely <m>p(c)</m>,
      is <m>0</m>, which means <m>(x-c)</m> is a factor of <m>p</m>.
      What we have established is the fundamental connection between zeros of polynomials and factors of polynomials.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of the things The Factor Theorem tells us,
      the most pragmatic is that we had better find a more efficient way to divide polynomials by quantities of the form <m>x-c</m>.
      Fortunately,
      people like <url href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_division"><em>Ruffini</em></url> and <url href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horner_scheme"><em>Horner</em></url> have already blazed this trail.
      Let's take a closer look at the long division we performed at the beginning of the section and try to streamline it.
      First off, let's change all of the subtractions into additions by distributing through the <m>-1</m>s.

      Next, observe that the terms <m>-x^3</m>,
      <m>-6x^2</m> and <m>-7x</m> are the exact opposite of the terms above them.
      The algorithm we use ensures this is always the case,
      so we can omit them without losing any information.
      Also note that the terms we <q>bring down</q>
      (namely the <m>-5x</m> and <m>-14</m>)
      aren't really necessary to recopy, so we omit them, too.

      Now, let's move things up a bit and,
      for reasons which will become clear in a moment,

      Note that by arranging things in this manner,
      each term in the last row is obtained by adding the two terms above it.
      Notice also that the quotient polynomial can be obtained by dividing each of the first three terms in the last row by <m>x</m> and adding the results.
      If you take the time to work back through the original division problem,
      you will find that this is exactly the way we determined the quotient polynomial.
      This means that we no longer need to write the quotient polynomial down,
      nor the <m>x</m> in the divisor, to determine our answer.

      We've streamlined things quite a bit so far, but we can still do more.
      Let's take a moment to remind ourselves where the <m>2x^2</m>,
      <m>12x</m> and <m>14</m> came from in the second row.
      Each of these terms was obtained by multiplying the terms in the quotient,
      <m>x^2</m>,
      <m>6x</m> and <m>7</m>, respectively,
      by the <m>-2</m> in <m>x-2</m>,
      then by <m>-1</m> when we changed the subtraction to addition.
      Multiplying by <m>-2</m> then by <m>-1</m> is the same as multiplying by <m>2</m>,
      so we replace the <m>-2</m> in the divisor by <m>2</m>.
      Furthermore,
      the coefficients of the quotient polynomial match the coefficients of the first three terms in the last row,
      so we now take the plunge and write only the coefficients of the terms to get

      The first three numbers in the last row of our tableau are the coefficients of the quotient polynomial.
      Remember, we started with a third degree polynomial and divided by a first degree polynomial,
      so the quotient is a second degree polynomial.
      Hence the quotient is <m>x^2+6x+7</m>.
      The number in the box is the remainder.
      Synthetic division is our tool of choice for dividing polynomials by divisors of the form <m>x-c</m>.
      Also take note that when a polynomial
      (of degree at least <m>1</m>)
      is divided by <m>x-c</m>,
      the result will be a polynomial of exactly one less degree.
      Finally, it is worth the time to trace each step in synthetic division back to its corresponding step in long division.
      While the authors have done their best to indicate where the algorithm comes from,
      there is no substitute for working through it yourself.

        For divisors of the form <m>ax+b</m>,

              To divide <m>4-8x-12x^2</m> by <m>2x-3</m>, two things must be done.
              First, we write the dividend in descending powers of <m>x</m> as <m>-12x^2-8x+4</m>.
              Second, since synthetic division works only for factors of the form <m>x-c</m>,
              we factor <m>2x-3</m> as <m>2\left(x-\frac{3}{2}\right)</m>.
              Our strategy is to first divide
              <m>-12x^2-8x+4</m> by <m>2</m>, to get <m>-6x^2-4x+2</m>.
              Next, we divide by <m>\left(x-\frac{3}{2}\right)</m>.
              The tableau becomes
              <me>
                \begin{array}{rrrr}

        <p>
          From this, we get <m>-6x^2-4x+2 = \left(x-\frac{3}{2}\right)(-6 x - 13) - \frac{35}{2}</m>.
          Multiplying both sides by <m>2</m> and distributing gives <m>-12x^2-8x+4 = \left(2x-3\right) (-6 x - 13) - 35</m>.
          At this stage, we have written <m>-12x^2-8x+4</m> in the
          <em>form</em> <m>(2x-3) q(x) + r(x)</m>,
          but how can we be sure the quotient polynomial is <m>-6x-13</m> and the remainder is <m>-35</m>?
          The answer is the word <q>unique</q>
          in <xref ref="polydiv">Theorem</xref>.
          The theorem states that there is only one way to decompose
          <m>-12x^2-8x+4</m> into a multiple of <m>(2x-3)</m> plus a constant term.
          Since we have found such a way,
          we can be sure it is the only way.

      A couple of things about the last example are worth mentioning.
      First, the extension of the synthetic division tableau for repeated divisions will be a common sight in the sections to come.
      Typically, we will start with a higher order polynomial and peel off one zero at a time until we are left with a quadratic,
      whose roots can always be found using the Quadratic Formula.
      Secondly, we found <m>x = \pm \sqrt{3}</m> are zeros of <m>p</m>.
      The Factor Theorem guarantees <m>\left(x-\sqrt{3}\right)</m> and
      <m>\left(x - \left(-\sqrt{3}\right)\right)</m> are both factors of <m>p</m>.
      We can certainly put the Factor Theorem to the test and continue the synthetic division tableau from above to see what happens.
