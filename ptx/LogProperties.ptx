  <title>Properties of Logarithms</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="IntroExpLogs">Section</xref>,
      we introduced the logarithmic functions as inverses of exponential functions and discussed a few of their functional properties from that perspective.
      In this section, we explore the algebraic properties of logarithms.
      Historically,
      these have played a huge role in the scientific development of our society since,
      among other things,
      they were used to develop analog computing devices called <url href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slide_rule"><em>slide rules</em></url> which enabled scientists and engineers to perform accurate calculations leading to such things as space travel and the <url href="http://www.redorbit.com/news/space/73297/nasa_marks_35th_anniversary_of_first_moon_landing/"><em>moon landing</em></url>.
      As we shall see shortly,
      logs inherit analogs of all of the properties of exponents you learned in Elementary and Intermediate Algebra.
      We first extract two properties from <xref ref="logfcnprops">Theorem</xref>
      to remind us of the definition of a logarithm as the inverse of an exponential function.

      We now state the algebraic properties of exponential functions which will serve as a basis for the properties of logarithms.
      While these properties may look identical to the ones you learned in Elementary and Intermediate Algebra,
      they apply to real number exponents,
      not just rational exponents.
      Note that in the theorem that follows,
      we are interested in the properties of exponential functions,
      so the base <m>b</m> is restricted to <m>b > 0</m>, <m>b \neq 1</m>.

          </ul>

      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      There are a couple of different ways to understand why <xref ref="algproplogfcns">Theorem</xref> is true.
      Consider the product rule: <m>\log_{b}(uw) = \log_{b}(u) + \log_{b}(w)</m>.
      Let <m>a = \log_{b}(uw)</m>,
      <m>c = \log_{b}(u)</m>, and <m>d = \log_{b}(w)</m>.
      Then, by definition, <m>b^{a} = uw</m>,
      <m>b^{c} = u</m> and <m>b^{d} = w</m>.
      Hence, <m>b^{a} = uw = b^{c} b^{d} = b^{c+d}</m>,
      so that <m>b^{a} = b^{c+d}</m>.
      By the one-to-one property of <m>b^{x}</m>, we have <m>a = c+d</m>.
      In other words, <m>\log_{b}(uw) = \log_{b}(u) + \log_{b}(w)</m>.
      The remaining properties are proved similarly.
      From a purely functional approach,
      we can see the properties in <xref ref="algproplogfcns">Theorem</xref>
      as an example of how inverse functions interchange the roles of inputs in outputs.
      For instance,
      the Product Rule for exponential functions given in <xref ref="algpropexpfcns">Theorem</xref>,
      <m>f(u+w) = f(u)f(w)</m>,
      says that adding inputs results in multiplying outputs.
      Hence, whatever <m>f^{-1}</m> is,
      it must take the products of outputs from <m>f</m> and return them to the sum of their respective inputs.
      Since the outputs from <m>f</m> are the inputs to <m>f^{-1}</m> and vice-versa,
      we have that that <m>f^{-1}</m> must take products of its inputs to the sum of their respective outputs.
      This is precisely what the Product Rule for Logarithmic functions states in <xref ref="algproplogfcns">Theorem</xref>:
      <m>g(uw) = g(u) + g(w)</m>.
      The reader is encouraged to view the remaining properties listed in <xref ref="algproplogfcns">Theorem</xref> similarly.
      The following examples help build familiarity with these properties.
      In our first example, we are asked to
      <q>expand</q> the logarithms.
      This means that we read the properties in <xref ref="algproplogfcns">Theorem</xref>
      from left to right and rewrite products inside the log as sums outside the log,
      quotients inside the log as differences outside the log,
      and powers inside the log as factors outside the log.

                In the expression <m>\log_{0.1} \left(10 x^2 \right)</m>,
                we have a power

                and a product.
                In order to use the Product Rule,
                the <em>entire</em>
                quantity inside the logarithm must be raised to the same exponent.
                Since the exponent <m>2</m> applies only to the <m>x</m>,
                we first apply the Product Rule with <m>u=10</m> and <m>w=x^2</m>.

                Since the exponent <m>2</m> applies to the entire quantity inside the logarithm,
                we begin with the Power Rule with <m>u=\frac{3}{ex}</m> and <m>w = 2</m>.
                Next, we see the Quotient Rule is applicable,
                with <m>u=3</m> and <m>w=ex</m>,

                At first it seems as if we have no means of simplifying <m>\log_{117}\left(x^2-4\right)</m>,
                since none of the properties of logs addresses the issue of expanding a difference
                <em>inside</em> the logarithm.
                However, we may factor
          <m>x^2 - 4 = (x+2)(x-2)</m> thereby introducing a product which gives us license to use the Product Rule.
                <md>

    <p>
      A couple of remarks about <xref ref="expandlogex">Example</xref> are in order.
      First, while not explicitly stated in the above example,
      a general rule of thumb to determine which log property to apply first to a complicated problem is
      <q>reverse order of operations.</q> For example,
      if we were to substitute a number for <m>x</m> into the expression <m>\log_{0.1} \left(10 x^2 \right)</m>,
      we would first square the <m>x</m>,
      then multiply by <m>10</m>.
      The last step is the multiplication,
      which tells us the first log property to apply is the Product Rule.
      In a multi-step problem,
      this rule can give the required guidance on which log property to apply at each step.
      The reader is encouraged to look through the solutions to <xref ref="expandlogex">Example</xref> to see this rule in action.
      Second, while we were instructed to assume when necessary that all quantities represented positive real numbers,
      the authors would be committing a sin of omission if we failed to point out that,
      for instance,
      the functions <m>f(x) = \log_{117}\left(x^2-4\right)</m> and
      <m>g(x) = \log_{117}(x+2) + \log_{117}(x-2)</m> have different domains, and,
      hence, are different functions.
      We leave it to the reader to verify the domain of <m>f</m> is
      <m>(-\infty, -2) \cup (2,\infty)</m> whereas the domain of <m>g</m> is <m>(2,\infty)</m>.
      In general, when using log properties to expand a logarithm,
      we may very well be restricting the domain as we do so.
      One last comment before we move to reassembling logs from their various bits and pieces.
      The authors are well aware of the propensity for some students to become overexcited and invent their own properties of logs like <m>\log_{117}\left(x^2-4\right) = \log_{117}\left(x^2\right) - \log_{117}(4)</m>,
      which simply isn't true, in general.
      The unwritten
      (the authors relish the irony involved in writing what follows)
      property of logarithms is that if it isn't written in a textbook,
      it probably isn't true.

          in this example we read them from right to left.

                The difference of logarithms requires the Quotient Rule:

                we have both a sum and difference of logarithms.
                However,
          before we use the product rule to combine <m>\log(x) + 2\log(y)</m>,
                we note that we need to somehow deal with the coefficient <m>2</m> on <m>\log(y)</m>.
                This can be handled using the Power Rule.
                We can then apply the Product and Quotient Rules as we move from left to right.
                Putting it all together, we have

      As we would expect,
      the rule of thumb for re-assembling logarithms is the opposite of what it was for dismantling them.
      That is, if we are interested in rewriting an expression as a single logarithm,
      we apply log properties following the usual order of operations:
      deal with multiples of logs first with the Power Rule,
      then deal with addition and subtraction using the Product and Quotient Rules,
      respectively.
      Additionally,
      we find that using log properties in this fashion can increase the domain of the expression.
      For example, we leave it to the reader to verify the domain of
      <m>f(x) = \log_{3}(x-1) - \log_{3}(x+1)</m> is <m>(1,\infty)</m> but the domain of
      <m>g(x) = \log_{3}\left(\frac{x-1}{x+1}\right)</m> is <m>(-\infty, -1) \cup (1, \infty)</m>.

      The two logarithm buttons commonly found on calculators are the
      <q>LOG</q> and <q>LN</q>
      buttons which correspond to the common and natural logs,
      respectively.
      Suppose we wanted an approximation to <m>\log_{2}(7)</m>.
      The answer should be a little less than <m>3</m>, (Can you explain why?) but how do we coerce the calculator into telling us a more accurate answer?
      We need the following theorem.

            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      The proofs of the Change of Base formulas are a result of the other properties studied in this section.
      If we start with <m>b^{x \log_{b}(a)}</m> and use the Power Rule in the exponent to rewrite <m>x \log_{b}(a)</m> as
      <m>\log_{b}\left(a^{x}\right)</m> and then apply one of the Inverse Properties in <xref ref="invpropslogs">Theorem</xref>, we get
      <me>
        b^{x \log_{b}(a)} = b^{\log_{b}\left(a^{x}\right)} = a^{x}
      </me>,
      as required.
      To verify the logarithmic form of the property,
      we also use the Power Rule and an Inverse Property.
      We note that
      <me>
        \log_{a}(x) \cdot \log_{b}(a) =  \log_{b} \left(a^{\log_{a}(x)}\right) = \log_{b}(x)
      </me>,
      and we get the result by dividing through by <m>\log_{b}(a)</m>.
      Of course, the authors can't help but point out the inverse relationship between these two change of base formulas.
      To change the base of an exponential expression,
      we <em>multiply</em> the <em>input</em>
      by the factor <m>\log_{b}(a)</m>.
      To change the base of a logarithmic expression,
      we <em>divide</em> the <em>output</em>
      by the factor <m>\log_{b}(a)</m>.
      What <xref ref="changeofbase">Theorem</xref>
      really tells us is that all exponential and logarithmic functions are just scalings of one another.
      Not only does this explain why their graphs have similar shapes,
      but it also tells us that we could do all of mathematics with a single base - be it <m>10</m>,
      <m>e</m>, <m>42</m>, or <m>117</m>.
    </p>

    <aside>
      <p>
        While, in the grand scheme of things,
        both change of base formulas are really saying the same thing,
        the logarithmic form is the one usually encountered in Algebra while the exponential form isn't usually introduced until Calculus.
        The authors feel so strongly about showing students that every property of logarithms comes from and corresponds to a property of exponents that we have broken tradition with the vast majority of other authors in this field.
        This isn't the first time this happened,
        and it certainly won't be the last.
