  <title>Real Zeros of Polynomials</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="Polydivision">Section</xref>,
      we found that we can use synthetic division to determine if a given real number is a zero of a polynomial function.
      This section presents results which will help us determine good candidates to test using synthetic division.
      Our ability to find zeros of a polynomial depends on a number of factors,
      including the degree of the polynomial
      (by now, you should know exactly what to do if handed a linear or quadratic polynomial!)
      and whether or not we have access to technology.
      Whatever approach we are using,
      when searching for zeros, it helps to know where to look.
      The following theorem by the famous mathematician <url href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy"><em>Augustin Cauchy</em></url>,
      gives us an interval on which all of the real zeros of a polynomial can be found.

          Suppose <m>f(x) = a_{n} x^{n} + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_{1} x + a_{0}</m> is a polynomial of degree <m>n</m> with <m>n \geq 1</m>.

          <ellipsis />, <m>\frac{|a_{n-1}|}{|a_{n}|}</m>.

        The proof of <xref ref="CauchysBound">Theorem</xref>

      Like many of the results in this section, Cauchy's Bound is best understood with an example.

    <example xml:id="CBex">
      <title>Using Cauchy's Bound</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f(x) = 2x^4+4x^3-x^2-6x-3</m>.
          Determine an interval which contains all of the real zeros of <m>f</m>.

      <solution>
        <p>
          To find the <m>M</m> stated in Cauchy's Bound,
          we take the absolute value of the leading coefficient,
          in this case <m>|2| = 2</m> and divide it into the largest
          (in absolute value)
          of the remaining coefficients,
          in this case <m>|-6| = 6</m>.
          This yields <m>M=3</m> so it is guaranteed that all of the real zeros of <m>f</m> lie in the interval <m>[-4,4]</m>.

      Whereas the previous result tells us <em>where</em>
      we can find the real zeros of a polynomial,
      the next theorem gives us a list of
      <em>possible</em> real zeros.

      <title>Rational Zeros Theorem</title>

        <p>
              <idx><h>Rational Zeros Theorem</h></idx>
          Suppose <m>f(x) = a_{n} x^{n} + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_{1} x + a_{0}</m> is a polynomial of degree <m>n</m> with <m>n \geq 1</m>,

          then <m>r</m> is of the form <m>\pm \frac{p}{q}</m>,
          where <m>p</m> is a factor of the constant term <m>a_{0}</m>,
          and <m>q</m> is a factor of the leading coefficient <m>a_{n}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      The Rational Zeros Theorem gives us a list of numbers to try in our synthetic division and that is a lot nicer than simply guessing.
      If none of the numbers in the list are zeros,
      then either the polynomial has no real zeros at all,
      or all of the real zeros are irrational numbers.
      To see why the Rational Zeros Theorem works,
      suppose <m>c</m> is a zero of <m>f</m> and <m>c = \frac{p}{q}</m> in lowest terms.
      This means <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> have no common factors.
      Since <m>f(c) = 0</m>, we have
      <me>
        a_{n} \left(\frac{p}{q}\right)^{n} + a_{n-1}\left(\frac{p}{q}\right)^{n-1} + \ldots + a_{1} \left(\frac{p}{q}\right) + a_{0} = 0
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Multiplying both sides of this equation by <m>q^n</m>,
      we clear the denominators to get
      <me>
        a_{n}p^{n} + a_{n-1}p^{n-1}q + \ldots + a_{1}p q^{n-1} + a_{0}q^n = 0
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Rearranging this equation, we get
      <me>
        a_{n}p^{n} = -a_{n-1}p^{n-1}q - \ldots - a_{1}p q^{n-1} -a_{0}q^n
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, the left hand side is an integer multiple of <m>p</m>,
      and the right hand side is an integer multiple of <m>q</m>. (Can you see why?) This means
      <m>a_{n}p^{n}</m> is both a multiple of <m>p</m> and a multiple of <m>q</m>.
      Since <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> have no common factors,
      <m>a_{n}</m> must be a multiple of <m>q</m>.
      If we rearrange the equation
      <me>
        a_{n}p^{n} + a_{n-1}p^{n-1}q + \ldots + a_{1}p q^{n-1} + a_{0}q^n = 0
      </me>
      as
      <me>
        a_{0}q^n = -a_{n}p^{n} - a_{n-1}p^{n-1}q - \ldots - a_{1}p q^{n-1}
      </me>
      we can play the same game and conclude <m>a_{0}</m> is a multiple of <m>p</m>,
      and we have the result.

      <title>Finding rational zeros</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f(x) = 2x^4+4x^3-x^2-6x-3</m>.
          Use the Rational Zeros Theorem to list all of the possible rational zeros of <m>f</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          To generate a complete list of rational zeros,
          we need to take each of the factors of constant term,
          <m>a_{0} = -3</m>,
          and divide them by each of the factors of the leading coefficient <m>a_{4} = 2</m>.
          The factors of <m>-3</m> are <m>\pm \, 1</m> and <m>\pm \, 3</m>.
          Since the Rational Zeros Theorem tacks on a <m>\pm</m> anyway,
          for the moment,
          we consider only the positive factors <m>1</m> and <m>3</m>.
          The factors of <m>2</m> are <m>1</m> and <m>2</m>,
          so the Rational Zeros Theorem gives the list
          <m>\left\{\pm \, \frac{1}{1}, \pm \, \frac{1}{2}, \pm \, \frac{3}{1}, \pm \, \frac{3}{2}\right\}</m> or <m>\left\{\pm \, \frac{1}{2}, \pm \, 1, \pm \, \frac{3}{2}, \pm \, 3\right\}</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>

    <p>
      At this stage,
      we know not only the interval in which all of the zeros of <m>f(x) = 2x^4+4x^3-x^2-6x-3</m> are located,
      but we also know some potential candidates.
      If we have access to software or a graphing calculator,
      we can use it to help us determine all of the real zeros of <m>f</m>,
      as illustrated in the next example.

                From the graph,
                it looks as if we can rule out any of the positive rational zeros,
                since the graph seems to cross the <m>x</m>-axis at a value just a little greater than <m>1</m>.
                On the negative side, <m>-1</m> looks good,
                so we try that for our synthetic division.

                We have a winner!
                Remembering that <m>f</m> was a fourth degree polynomial,
                we know that our quotient is a third degree polynomial.
                If we can do one more successful division,
                we will have knocked the quotient down to a quadratic, and,
                if all else fails,
                we can use the quadratic formula to find the last two zeros.
                Since there seems to be no other rational zeros to try,
                we continue with <m>-1</m>.
                Also,
          the shape of the crossing at <m>x = -1</m> leads us to wonder if the zero <m>x = -1</m> has multiplicity 3.

                Success!
                Our quotient polynomial is now <m>2x^2 - 3</m>.
                Setting this to zero gives <m>2x^2 - 3 = 0</m>,
                or <m>x^2 = \frac{3}{2}</m>,
                which gives us <m>x = \pm \, \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}</m>.
                Concerning multiplicities, based on our division,
                we have that <m>-1</m> has a multiplicity of at least <m>2</m>.
                The Factor Theorem tells us our remaining zeros,
                <m>\pm \, \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}</m>,
                each have multiplicity at least <m>1</m>.
                However, <xref ref="nzerosreal">Theorem</xref>
                tells us <m>f</m> can have at most <m>4</m> real zeros,
                counting multiplicity,
                and so we conclude that <m>-1</m> is of multiplicity exactly <m>2</m> and
                <m>\pm \, \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}</m> each has multiplicity <m>1</m>.  (Thus,
                we were <em>wrong</em>
                to think that <m>-1</m> had multiplicity <m>3</m>.)

    </example>

    <p>
      It is interesting to note that we could greatly improve on the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> in the previous example given to us by GeoGebra.
      For instance,
      from our determination of the zeros of <m>f</m> and their multiplicities,
      we know the graph crosses at
      <m>x=-\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2} \approx -1.22</m> then turns back upwards to touch the <m>x-</m>axis at <m>x=-1</m>.
      This tells us that,
      despite what the software showed us the first time,
      there is a relative maximum occurring at <m>x = -1</m> and not a
      <q>flattened crossing</q> as we originally believed.
      After zooming in and rescaling the coordinate axes,
      we see not only the relative maximum but also a relative minimum
      (this is an example of what is called
      <q>hidden behaviour.</q>)
      just to the left of <m>x = -1</m> which shows us, once again,
      that Mathematics enhances the technology, instead of vice-versa:
      see <xref ref="fig_realzero2">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <aside>
      <p>
        The <m>y</m>-axis isn't visible in <xref ref="fig_realzero2">Figure</xref>,
        so it's worth pointing out that in order to get a good view of the two local extrema,
        we had to shrink the <m>y</m> scale significantly:
        the <m>y</m>-value of the local minimum at
        <m>x=-\sqrt{6}/2</m> is just shy of <m>-0.01</m>.

                From the graph, we know <m>f</m> has two real zeros,
                one positive, and one negative.
                Our only hope at this point is to try and find the zeros of <m>f</m> by setting <m>f(x)=x^4+x^2-12=0</m> and solving.
                If we stare at this equation long enough,
                we may recognize it as a
          <q>quadratic in disguise</q> or
                <q>quadratic in form</q>.
                In other words, we have three terms:
                <m>x^4</m>, <m>x^2</m> and <m>12</m>,
                and the exponent on the first term, <m>x^4</m>,
                is exactly twice that of the second term, <m>x^2</m>.
                We may rewrite this as <m>\left(x^2\right)^2 + \left(x^2\right) - 12 = 0</m>.
                To better see the forest for the trees,
                we momentarily replace <m>x^2</m> with the variable <m>u</m>.
                In terms of <m>u</m>, our equation becomes <m>u^2 + u - 12 = 0</m>,
                which we can readily factor as <m>(u+4)(u-3) = 0</m>.
                In terms of <m>x</m>,
                this means <m>x^4+x^2-12= \left(x^2-3\right) \left(x^2 + 4 \right)=0</m>.
                We get <m>x^2 = 3</m>,
          which gives us <m>x = \pm \sqrt{3}</m>,
                or <m>x^2=-4</m>,
                which admits no real solutions.
                Since <m>\sqrt{3} \approx 1.73</m>,
                the two zeros match what we expected from the graph.
                In terms of multiplicity,
                the Factor Theorem guarantees <m>\left(x - \sqrt{3}\right)</m> and
                <m>\left(x + \sqrt{3}\right)</m> are factors of <m>f(x)</m>.
                Since <m>f(x)</m> can be factored as <m>f(x) = \left(x^2-3\right) \left(x^2 + 4 \right)</m>,
                and <m>x^2 + 4</m> has no real zeros,
                the quantities <m>\left(x - \sqrt{3}\right)</m> and
                <m>\left(x + \sqrt{3}\right)</m> must both be factors of <m>x^2-3</m>.
                According to <xref ref="nzerosreal">Theorem</xref>,
                <m>x^2-3</m> can have at most <m>2</m> zeros, counting multiplicity,
                hence each of <m>\pm \sqrt{3}</m> is a zero of <m>f</m> of multiplicity <m>1</m>.

      The technique used to factor <m>f(x)</m> in <xref ref="usubex">Example</xref> is called
          <idx><h><m>u</m>-substitution</h></idx>
      <em><m>u</m>-substitution</em>.
      In general, substitution can help us identify a
      <q>quadratic in disguise</q>
      provided that there are exactly three terms and the exponent of the first term is exactly twice that of the second.
      It is entirely possible that a polynomial has no real roots at all,
      or worse,
      it has real roots but none of the techniques discussed in this section can help us find them exactly.
      In the latter case, we are forced to approximate,
      which in this subsection means we use the <q>Zero</q>
      command on the graphing calculator. (In GeoGebra,
      there is a <q>root</q> command available,
      or you can simply use the Intersect tool to plot the points where the graph intersects the <m>x</m>-axis.)

      Cauchy's Bound gives us a general bound on the zeros of a polynomial function.
      Our next result helps us determine bounds on the real zeros of a polynomial as we synthetically divide which are often sharper
      (that is, better, or more accurate)
      bounds than Cauchy's Bound.

      The Upper and Lower Bounds Theorem works because of <xref ref="polydiv">Theorem</xref>.
      For the upper bound part of the theorem,
      suppose <m>c>0</m> is divided into <m>f</m> and the resulting line in the division tableau contains,
      for example, all nonnegative numbers.
      This means <m>f(x) = (x-c) q(x) + r</m>,
      where the coefficients of the quotient polynomial and the remainder are nonnegative. (Note that the leading coefficient of <m>q</m> is the same as <m>f</m> so <m>q(x)</m> is not the zero polynomial.) If <m>b > c</m>,
      then <m>f(b) = (b-c) q(b) + r</m>,
      where <m>(b-c)</m> and <m>q(b)</m> are both positive and <m>r \geq 0</m>.
      Hence <m>f(b) > 0</m> which shows <m>b</m> cannot be a zero of <m>f</m>.
      Thus no real number <m>b > c</m> can be a zero of <m>f</m>,
      as required.
      A similar argument proves
      <m>f(b) \lt 0</m> if all of the numbers in the final line of the synthetic division tableau are non-positive.
      To prove the lower bound part of the theorem,
      we note that a lower bound for the negative real zeros of <m>f(x)</m> is an upper bound for the positive real zeros of <m>f(-x)</m>.
      Applying the upper bound portion to <m>f(-x)</m> gives the result. (Do you see where the alternating signs come in?) With the additional mathematical machinery of Descartes' Rule of Signs and the Upper and Lower Bounds Theorem,
      we can find the real zeros of
      <m>f(x) = 2x^4+4x^3-x^2-6x-3</m> without the use of technology.

                We know from Cauchy's Bound that all of the real zeros lie in the interval <m>[-4,4]</m> and that our possible rational zeros are <m>\pm \, \frac{1}{2}</m>,
                <m>\pm \, 1</m>, <m>\pm \, \frac{3}{2}</m> and <m>\pm \, 3</m>.
                We try our positive rational zeros,
                starting with the smallest, <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>.
                Since the remainder isn't zero,
                we know <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> isn't a zero.
                Sadly,
          the final line in the division tableau has both positive and negative numbers,
                so <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> is not an upper bound.
                The only information we get from this division is courtesy of the Remainder Theorem which tells us <m>f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\frac{45}{8}</m> so the point
                <m>\left(\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{45}{8}\right)</m> is on the graph of <m>f</m>.
                We continue to our next possible zero, <m>1</m>.
                As before,
          the only information we can glean from this is that <m>(1,-4)</m> is on the graph of <m>f</m>.
                When we try our next possible zero,
                <m>\frac{3}{2}</m>, we get that it is not a zero,
                and we also see that it is an upper bound on the zeros of <m>f</m>,
                since all of the numbers in the final line of the division tableau are positive.
                This means there is no point trying our last possible rational zero,
                <m>3</m>.
                Although we did not find any positive rational zeros,
                we can conclude that there must be a positive irrational zero:
                we found that <m>f(1) = -4 \lt 0</m> and <m>f\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{75}{8} > 0</m>,
                so the Intermediate Value Theorem,
                <xref ref="IVT">Theorem</xref>,
                tells us the zero lies between <m>1</m> and
                <m>\frac{3}{2}</m>. <tabular> <row> <cell><m>\begin{array}{rrrrrr} \frac{1}{2} \, \, \vline\amp 2 \amp 4 \amp -1 \amp -6 \amp -3 \\ \amp \downarrow \amp 1 \amp \frac{5}{2} \amp \frac{3}{4} \amp -\frac{21}{8} \\ \hhline{~-----} \amp 2 \amp 5 \amp \frac{3}{2} \amp -\frac{21}{4} \amp \fbox{<m>-\frac{45}{8}</m>} \end{array}</m></cell> </row> <row> <cell><m>\begin{array}{rrrrrr} 1 \, \, \vline\amp 2 \amp 4 \amp -1 \amp -6 \amp -3 \\ \amp \downarrow \amp 2 \amp 6 \amp 5 \amp -1 \\ \hhline{~-----} \amp 2 \amp 6 \amp 5 \amp -1 \amp \fbox{<m>-4</m>} \end{array}</m></cell> </row> <row> <cell><m>\begin{array}{rrrrrr} \frac{3}{2} \, \, \vline\amp 2 \amp 4 \amp -1 \amp -6 \amp -3 \\ \amp \downarrow \amp 3 \amp \frac{21}{2} \amp \frac{57}{4} \amp \frac{99}{8} \\ \hhline{~-----} \amp 2 \amp 7 \amp \frac{19}{2} \amp \frac{33}{4} \amp \fbox{<m>\frac{75}{8}</m>} \end{array}</m></cell> </row> </tabular> We now turn our attention to negative real zeros.
                We try the largest possible zero, <m>-\frac{1}{2}</m>.
                Synthetic division shows us it is not a zero, nor is it a lower bound
                (since the numbers in the final line of the division tableau do not alternate),
                so we proceed to <m>-1</m>.
                This division shows <m>-1</m> is a zero.
                Since we're only aware of one positive real zero and <m>f</m> has degree 4, we may have as many as three negative real zeros,
                counting multiplicity,
          so we try <m>-1</m> again, and it works once more.
                At this point, we have taken <m>f</m>,
                a fourth degree polynomial,
          and performed two successful divisions.
                Our quotient polynomial is quadratic,
                so we look at it to find the remaining zeros. <tabular> <row> <cell><m>\begin{array}{rrrrrr} -\frac{1}{2} \, \, \vline\amp 2 \amp 4 \amp -1 \amp -6 \amp -3 \\ \amp \downarrow \amp -1 \amp -\frac{3}{2} \amp \frac{5}{4} \amp \frac{19}{8} \\ \hhline{~-----} \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp -\frac{5}{2} \amp -\frac{19}{4} \amp \fbox{<m>-\frac{5}{8}</m>} \end{array}</m></cell> </row> <row> <cell><m>\begin{array}{rrrrrr} -1 \, \, \vline\amp 2 \amp 4 \amp -1 \amp -6 \amp -3 \\ \amp \downarrow \amp -2 \amp -2 \amp 3 \amp 3\\ \hhline{~-----} -1 \, \, \vline\amp 2 \amp 2 \amp -3 \amp -3 \amp \fbox{<m>0</m>} \\ \amp \downarrow \amp -2 \amp 0 \amp 3 \amp \\ \hhline{~----} \amp 2 \amp 0 \amp -3\amp \fbox{0} \amp \end{array}</m></cell> </row> </tabular> Setting the quotient polynomial equal to zero yields <m>2x^2 - 3 = 0</m>,
                so that <m>x^2 = \frac{3}{2}</m>,
                or <m>x = \pm \, \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}</m>.
                We now have two zeros of multiplicity one yielding factors
                <m>\left(x-\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}\right)</m> and <m>\left(x+\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}\right)</m>,
                respectively and one zero of multiplicity two,
                which yields the factor <m>(x+1)^2</m>.
                Since multiplying the corresponding factors together produces a polynomial of degree 4, we know that we have found all possible zeros of <m>f</m>. (If there were another zero,
                we would have another factor,
                and multiplying by this factor would produce a polynomial of degree 5 or more.)

                We know the end behaviour of <m>y=f(x)</m> resembles that of its leading term <m>y=2x^4</m>.
                This means that the graph enters the scene in Quadrant II and exits in Quadrant I. Since
                <m>\pm \, \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}</m> are zeros of odd multiplicity,
                we have that the graph crosses through the <m>x</m>-axis at the points
                <m>\left( -\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}, 0 \right)</m> and <m>\left( \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}, 0 \right)</m>.
                Since <m>-1</m> is a zero of multiplicity <m>2</m>,
                the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> touches and rebounds off the <m>x</m>-axis at <m>(-1,0)</m>.
                Putting this together,

      You can see why the <q>no calculator</q>
      approach is not very popular these days.
      It requires more computation and more theorems than the alternative. (This is apparently a bad thing.) In general,
      no matter how many theorems you throw at a polynomial,
      it may well be impossible to find their zeros exactly.
      The polynomial <m>f(x) = x^5-x-1</m> is one such beast.
      The Rational Zeros Test gives us <m>\pm 1</m> as rational zeros to try but neither of these work since <m>f(1) = f(-1) = -1</m>.
      If we try the substitution technique we used in <xref ref="usubex">Example</xref>,
      we find <m>f(x)</m> has three terms,
      but the exponent on the <m>x^5</m> isn't exactly twice the exponent on <m>x</m>.
      How could we go about approximating the positive zero without resorting to the <q>Zero</q>
      command of a graphing calculator?
      We use the
          <idx><h>Bisection Method</h></idx>
      <em>Bisection Method</em>.
      The first step in the Bisection Method is to find an interval on which <m>f</m> changes sign.
      We know <m>f(1) = -1</m> and we find <m>f(2) = 29</m>.
      By the Intermediate Value Theorem,
      we know that the zero of <m>f</m> lies in the interval <m>[1,2]</m>.
      Next, we <q>bisect</q> this interval and find the midpoint is <m>1.5</m>.
      We have that <m>f(1.5)\approx 5.09</m>.
      This means that our zero is between <m>1</m> and <m>1.5</m>,
      since <m>f</m> changes sign on this interval.
      Now, we <q>bisect</q> the interval <m>[1,1.5]</m> and find <m>f(1.25) \approx 0.80</m>,
      so now we have the zero between <m>1</m> and <m>1.25</m>.
      Bisecting <m>[1,1.25]</m>, we find <m>f(1.125) \approx -0.32</m>,
      which means the zero of <m>f</m> is between <m>1.125</m> and <m>1.25</m>.
      We continue in this fashion until we have <q>sandwiched</q>
      the zero between two numbers which differ by no more than a desired accuracy.
      You can think of the Bisection Method as reversing the sign diagram process:
      instead of finding the zeros and checking the sign of <m>f</m> using test values,
      we are using test values to determine where the signs switch to find the zeros.
      It is a slow and tedious,
      yet fool-proof, method for approximating a real zero.

              <p>
                To solve this nonlinear inequality,
                we follow the same guidelines set forth in <xref ref="Inequalities">Section</xref>:
                we get <m>0</m> on one side of the inequality and construct a sign diagram.
                Our original inequality can be rewritten as <m>2x^5-3x^4+6x^3-8x^2+3 \leq 0</m>.
                We found the zeros of
          <m>p(x) = 2x^5-3x^4+6x^3-8x^2+3</m> in part 1 to be <m>x=-\frac{1}{2}</m> and <m>x=1</m>.
                We construct our sign diagram as before,
                giving us <xref ref="fig_sdzeros1">Figure</xref>. <figure xml:id="fig_sdzeros1"> <caption>The sign diagram for <m>p(x)</m> in <xref ref="polyeqineqexample">Example</xref></caption> <image source="figures/PolynomialsGraphics/RealZeros_New-2"></image> </figure> The solution to
                <m>p(x) \lt 0</m> is <m>\left(-\infty, -\frac{1}{2}\right)</m>,
                and we know <m>p(x) = 0</m> at <m>x=-\frac{1}{2}</m> and <m>x=1</m>.
                Hence, the solution to
          <m>p(x) \leq 0</m> is <m>\left(-\infty, -\frac{1}{2}\right] \cup \left\{1\right\}</m>.

            <li>
              <p>
                To interpret this solution graphically,
                we set <m>f(x) = 2x^5+6x^3+3</m> and <m>g(x) = 3x^4+8x^2</m>.
                We recall that the solution to
                <m>f(x) \leq g(x)</m> is the set of <m>x</m> values for which the graph of <m>f</m> is below the graph of <m>g</m> (where
                <m>f(x) \lt g(x)</m>) along with the <m>x</m> values where the two graphs intersect (<m>f(x) = g(x)</m>).
                Graphing <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> using GeoGebra produces <xref ref="fig_realzeroeg1">Figure</xref>(a). (The end behaviour should tell you which is which.) We see that the graph of <m>f</m> is below the graph of <m>g</m> on <m>\left(-\infty, -\frac{1}{2}\right)</m>.
                However,
          it is difficult to see what is happening near <m>x=1</m>.
                Zooming in
                (and making the graph of <m>g</m> thicker),
                we see in <xref ref="fig_realzeroeg1">Figure</xref>(b) that the graphs of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> do intersect at <m>x=1</m>,
                but the graph of <m>g</m> remains below the graph of <m>f</m> on either side of <m>x = 1</m>.

          from producing and selling <m>x</m> <em>hundred</em>
          LCD TVs is given by <m>P(x)=-5x^3+35x^2-45x-25</m>,
          <m>0 \leq x \leq 10.07</m>.
          How many TVs should be produced to make a profit?
          Check your answer using a graphing utility.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          To <q>make a profit</q>
          means to solve <m>P(x) = -5x^3+35x^2-45x-25 > 0</m>,
          which we do analytically using a sign diagram.
          To simplify things,
          we first factor out the <m>-5</m> common to all the coefficients to get <m>-5\left(x^3 - 7x^2+9x-5\right) > 0</m>,
          so we can just focus on finding the zeros of <m>f(x) = x^3-7x^2+9x+5</m>.
          The possible rational zeros of <m>f</m> are <m>\pm 1</m> and <m>\pm 5</m>,
          and going through the usual computations,
          we find <m>x=5</m> is the only rational zero.
          Using this,
          we factor <m>f(x) = x^3-7x^2+9x+5 = (x-5) \left(x^2-2x-1\right)</m>,
          and we find the remaining zeros by applying the Quadratic Formula to <m>x^2-2x-1 = 0</m>.
          We find three real zeros,
          <m>x=1-\sqrt{2} = -0.414 \ldots</m>,
          <m>x = 1+\sqrt{2} = 2.414 \ldots</m>, and <m>x = 5</m>,
          of which only the last two fall in the applied domain of <m>[0, 10.07]</m>.
          We choose <m>x=0</m>,
          <m>x=3</m> and <m>x=10.07</m> as our test values and plug them into the function <m>P(x)=-5x^3+35x^2-45x-25</m> (not
          <m>f(x) =x^3 - 7x^2+9x-5</m>) to get the sign diagram in <xref ref="fig_sdzeros2">Figure</xref>.
        </p>

        <figure xml:id="fig_sdzeros2">
          <caption>The sign diagram for <m>P(x)</m> in <xref ref="ex_zerosappl">Example</xref></caption>
          <image source="figures/PolynomialsGraphics/RealZeros_New-3"></image>
        </figure>

        <p>
          We see immediately that <m>P(x)>0</m> on <m>(1+\sqrt{2},5)</m>.
          Since <m>x</m> measures the number of TVs in <em>hundreds</em>,
          <m>x = 1 + \sqrt{2}</m> corresponds to <m>241.4\ldots</m> TVs.
          Since we can't produce a fractional part of a TV, we need to choose between producing 241 and 242 TVs.
          From the sign diagram, we see that
          <m>P(2.41) \lt 0</m> but <m>P(2.42)>0</m> so,
          in this case we take the next <em>larger</em>
          integer value and set the minimum production to 242 TVs.
          At the other end of the interval,
          we have <m>x=5</m> which corresponds to <m>500</m> TVs.
          Here, we take the next <em>smaller</em> integer value,
          <m>499</m> TVs to ensure that we make a profit.
          Hence, in order to make a profit,
          at least 242, but no more than 499 TVs need to be produced.
          To check our answer using GeoGebra,
          we graph <m>y=P(x)</m> and use the Intersect tool to see where <m>y=P(x)</m> intersects the <m>x</m>-axis.
          We see in <xref ref="fig_applzeroeg">Figure</xref>
          that the software approximations bear out our analysis.

          Find the real zeros of <m>f(x) = x^{3} - \frac{1}{12}x^{2} - \frac{7}{72}x + \frac{1}{72}</m> by first finding a polynomial <m>q(x)</m> with integer coefficients such that
          <m>q(x) = N \cdot f(x)</m> for some integer <m>N</m>. (Recall that the Rational Zeros Theorem required the polynomial in question to have integer coefficients.) Show that <m>f</m> and <m>q</m> have the same real zeros.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          We choose <m>q(x) = 72x^{3} - 6x^{2} - 7x + 1 = 72 \cdot f(x)</m>.
          Clearly <m>f(x) = 0</m> if and only if
          <m>q(x) = 0</m> so they have the same real zeros.
          In this case, <m>x = -\frac{1}{3}, \; x = \frac{1}{6} \;</m> and
          <m>x = \frac{1}{4}</m> are the real zeros of both <m>f</m> and <m>q</m>.

          In <xref ref="boxnotopex">Example</xref>
          in <xref ref="GraphsofPolynomials">Section</xref>,
          a box with no top is constructed from a <m>10</m> inch <times /> <m>12</m> inch piece of cardboard by cutting out congruent squares from each corner of the cardboard and then folding the resulting tabs.
          We determined the volume of that box
          (in cubic inches)
          is given by <m>V(x) = 4x^3-44x^2+120x</m>,
          where <m>x</m> denotes the length of the side of the square which is removed from each corner
          (in inches),
          <m>0 \lt x \lt 5</m>.
          Solve the inequality <m>V(x) \geq 80</m> analytically and interpret your answer in the context of that example.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          <m>V(x) \geq 80</m> on <m>[1,5-\sqrt{5}] \cup [5+\sqrt{5}, \infty)</m>.
          Only the portion <m>[1,5-\sqrt{5}]</m> lies in the applied domain, however.
          In the context of the problem,
          this says for the volume of the box to be at least 80 cubic inches,
          the square removed from each corner needs to have a side length of at least 1 inch,
          but no more than <m>5-\sqrt{5} \approx 2.76</m> inches.

          for <m>x \geq 0</m> models the cost,
          in dollars, to produce <m>x</m> PortaBoy game systems.
          If the production budget is <m>\dollar5000</m>,
          find the number of game systems which can be produced and still remain under budget.

      <answer>
        <p>
          <m>C(x) \leq 5000</m> on (approximately) <m>(-\infty, 82.18]</m>.
          The portion of this which lies in the applied domain is <m>(0,82.18]</m>.
          Since <m>x</m> represents the number of game systems,
          we check <m>C(82) = 4983.04</m> and <m>C(83) = 5078.11</m>,
          so to remain within the production budget,
          anywhere between <m>1</m> and <m>82</m> game systems can be produced.
