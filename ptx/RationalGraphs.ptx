  <title>Graphs of Rational Functions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section,
      we take a closer look at graphing rational functions.
      In <xref ref="IntroRational">Section</xref>,
      we learned that the graphs of rational functions may have holes in them and could have vertical,
      horizontal and slant asymptotes.
      <xref ref="vavshole">Theorems</xref>,
      <xref ref="hathm"></xref> and <xref ref="sathm"></xref>
      tell us exactly when and where these behaviours will occur,
      and if we combine these results with what we already know about graphing functions,
      we will quickly be able to generate reasonable graphs of rational functions.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the standard tools we will use is the sign diagram which was first introduced in <xref ref="Inequalities">Section</xref>,
      and then revisited in <xref ref="GraphsofPolynomials">Section</xref>.
      In those sections,
      we operated under the belief that a function couldn't change its sign without its graph crossing through the <m>x</m>-axis.
      The major theorem we used to justify this belief was the Intermediate Value Theorem,
      <xref ref="IVT">Theorem</xref>.
      It turns out the Intermediate Value Theorem applies to all <em>continuous</em>
      functions, not just polynomials.
      Although rational functions are continuous on their domains,
      (another result from Calculus)
      <xref ref="vavshole">Theorem</xref>
      tells us that vertical asymptotes and holes occur at the values excluded from their domains.
      In other words,
      rational functions aren't continuous at these excluded values which leaves open the possibility that the function could change sign <em>without</em>
      crossing through the <m>x</m>-axis.
      Consider the graph of <m>y=h(x)</m> from <xref ref="ratfuncex">Example</xref>,
      reproduced in <xref ref="fig_ratgraph1">Figure</xref> for convenience.
      We have added its <m>x</m>-intercept at
      <m>\left(\frac{1}{2},0\right)</m> for the discussion that follows.
      Suppose we wish to construct a sign diagram for <m>h(x)</m>.
      Recall that the intervals where <m>h(x)>0</m>, or <m>(+)</m>,
      correspond to the <m>x</m>-values where the graph of <m>y=h(x)</m> is
      <em>above</em> the <m>x</m>-axis;
      the intervals on which <m>h(x) \lt 0</m>,
      or <m>(-)</m> correspond to where the graph is
      <em>below</em> the <m>x</m>-axis.
    </p>

    <aside>
      <p>
        Recall that at this stage
        (prior to discussing calculus),
        continuity of a function means that its graph is devoid of any breaks,
        jumps or holes.
        We'll define continuity more carefully once we've introduced limits.
      </p>

      <img src="figures/RationalsGraphics/RationalGraphs-1.pdf"/>
    </figure>

    <p>
      As we examine the graph of <m>y=h(x)</m>,
      reading from left to right, we note that from <m>(-\infty,-1)</m>,
      the graph is above the <m>x</m>-axis,
      so <m>h(x)</m> is <m>(+)</m> there.
      At <m>x=-1</m>, we have a vertical asymptote,
      at which point the graph <q>jumps</q> across the <m>x</m>-axis.
      On the interval <m>\left(-1,\frac{1}{2}\right)</m>,
      the graph is below the <m>x</m>-axis,
      so <m>h(x)</m> is <m>(-)</m> there.
      The graph crosses through the <m>x</m>-axis at
      <m>\left(\frac{1}{2},0\right)</m> and remains above the <m>x</m>-axis until <m>x=1</m>,
      where we have a <q>hole</q> in the graph.
      Since <m>h(1)</m> is undefined, there is no sign here.
      So we have <m>h(x)</m> as <m>(+)</m> on the interval <m>\left(\frac{1}{2}, 1\right)</m>.
      Continuing, we see that on <m>(1, \infty)</m>,
      the graph of <m>y=h(x)</m> is above the <m>x</m>-axis,
      so we mark <m>(+)</m> there.
      To construct a sign diagram from this information,
      we not only need to denote the zero of <m>h</m>,
      but also the places not in the domain of <m>h</m>.
      As is our custom, we write <q><m>0</m></q>
      above <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> on the sign diagram to remind us that it is a zero of <m>h</m>.
      We need a different notation for <m>-1</m> and <m>1</m>,
      and we have chosen to use <q>\textinterrobang</q>
      - a nonstandard symbol called the <url href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang"><em>interrobang</em></url>.
          <idx><h>interrobang</h></idx>
      We use this symbol to convey a sense of surprise,
      caution and wonderment - an appropriate attitude to take when approaching these points.
      The moral of the story is that when constructing sign diagrams for rational functions,
      we include the zeros as well as the values excluded from the domain.
      The final result is shown in <xref ref="fig_ratsd1">Figure</xref>.

          We follow the six step procedure outlined in <xref ref="idea_ratgraph">Key Idea</xref>.

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                As usual,
          we set the denominator equal to zero to get <m>x^2 - 4 = 0</m>.
                We find <m>x = \pm 2</m>,
                so our domain is <m>(-\infty, -2) \cup (-2,2) \cup (2,\infty)</m>.

            <li>
              <p>
                To reduce <m>f(x)</m> to lowest terms,
                we factor the numerator and denominator which yields <m>f(x) = \dfrac{3x}{(x-2)(x+2)}</m>.
                There are no common factors which means <m>f(x)</m> is already in lowest terms.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                To find the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m>,
                we set <m>y=f(x) = 0</m>.
                Solving <m>\dfrac{3x}{(x-2)(x+2)} = 0</m> results in <m>x=0</m>.
                Since <m>x=0</m> is in our domain,
                <m>(0,0)</m> is the <m>x</m>-intercept.
                To find the <m>y</m>-intercept,
                we set <m>x=0</m> and find <m>y = f(0) = 0</m>,
                so that <m>(0,0)</m> is our <m>y</m>-intercept as well.

                    As we mentioned at least once earlier,
                    since functions can have at most one <m>y</m>-intercept,
                    once we find that <m>(0,0)</m> is on the graph,
                    we know it is the <m>y</m>-intercept as well as an <m>x</m>-intercept.

            <li>
              <p>
                The two numbers excluded from the domain of <m>f</m> are <m>x = -2</m> and <m>x=2</m>.
                Since <m>f(x)</m> didn't reduce at all,
                both of these values of <m>x</m> still cause trouble in the denominator.
                Thus by <xref ref="vavshole">Theorem</xref>,
                <m>x=-2</m> and <m>x=2</m> are vertical asymptotes of the graph.
                We can actually go a step further at this point and determine exactly how the graph approaches the asymptote near each of these values.
                Though not absolutely necessary,
                it is good practice for when we reach calculus.
                For the discussion that follows,
                it is best to use the factored form of <m>f(x) = \dfrac{3x}{(x-2)(x+2)}</m>.

                <aside>
                  <p>
                    It's worth going through the analysis below to make sure we understand what's going on near the vertical asymptotes,
                    but it's not 100<percent /> necessary.
                    The sign diagram we construct in step 6 is the easiest way to determine the behaviour near the vertical asymptotes:
                    once we know the value of <m>f(x)</m> is going to be infinite,
                    it only remains to determine if it will be <m>+\infty</m> or <m>-\infty</m>.
                    Keep this in mind <mdash /> it will come in handy once we reach the discussion of infinite limits in our Calculus material.

                      Suppose <m>x \rightarrow -2^{-}</m>.
                      If we were to build a table of values,
                      we'd use <m>x</m>-values a little less than <m>-2</m>,
                      say <m>-2.1</m>,
                      <m>-2.01</m> and <m>-2.001</m>.
                      While there is no harm in actually building a table like we did in <xref ref="IntroRational">Section</xref>,
                      we want to develop a
          <q>number sense</q> here.
                      Let's think about each factor in the formula of <m>f(x)</m> as we imagine substituting a number like <m>x=-2.000001</m> into <m>f(x)</m>.
                      The quantity <m>3x</m> would be very close to <m>-6</m>,
                      the quantity <m>(x-2)</m> would be very close to <m>-4</m>,
                      and the factor <m>(x+2)</m> would be very close to <m>0</m>.
                      More specifically,
          <m>(x+2)</m> would be a little less than <m>0</m>,
                      in this case, <m>-0.000001</m>.
                      We will call such a number a
                <q>very small <m>(-)</m></q>,
                      <q>very small</q>
                      meaning close to zero in absolute value.
                      So, mentally, as <m>x \rightarrow -2^{-}</m>,
          we estimate
                      <md>
                        <mrow>f(x)  \amp  = \dfrac{3x}{(x-2)(x+2)} \approx \dfrac{-6}{(-4)\left( \mbox{very small \((-)\)} \right)}</mrow>
                        <mrow>\amp  = \dfrac{3}{2 \left( \mbox{very small \((-)\)} \right)}</mrow>
                      </md>
                      Now, the closer <m>x</m> gets to <m>-2</m>,
                      the smaller <m>(x+2)</m> will become,
                      so even though we are multiplying our
                      <q>very small <m>(-)</m></q> by <m>2</m>,
                      the denominator will continue to get smaller and smaller,
                      and remain negative.
                      The result is a fraction whose numerator is positive,
                      but whose denominator is very small and negative.
                      Mentally,
                      <me>
                        f(x) \approx \dfrac{3}{2 \left( \mbox{very small \((-)\)} \right)} \approx \dfrac{3}{\mbox{very small \((-)\)} } \approx \mbox{very big \((-)\)}
                      </me>
                      The term <q>very big <m>(-)</m></q>
                      means a number with a large absolute value which is negative. (The actual retail value of <m>f(-2.000001)</m> is approximately
                      <m>-1,\!500,\!000</m>.)  What all of this means is that as <m>x \rightarrow -2^{-}</m>,
                      <m>f(x) \rightarrow -\infty</m>.
                      Now suppose we wanted to determine the behaviour of <m>f(x)</m> as <m>x \rightarrow -2^{+}</m>.
                      If we imagine substituting something a little larger than <m>-2</m> in for <m>x</m>,
                      say <m>-1.999999</m>, we mentally estimate
                      <md>
                        <mrow>f(x) \amp  \approx \dfrac{-6}{(-4)\left( \mbox{very small \((+)\)} \right)} = \dfrac{3}{2 \left( \mbox{very small \((+)\)} \right)}</mrow>

                      </md>
                      We conclude that as <m>x \rightarrow -2^{+}</m>,
                      <m>f(x) \rightarrow \infty</m>.

                      we imagine substituting
                <m>x = 2.000001</m> to get <m>f(x) \approx \frac{3}{\mbox{\scriptsize very small <m>(+)</m>} } \approx \mbox{very big (+)}</m>.
                      So as <m>x \rightarrow 2^{+}, f(x) \rightarrow \infty</m>.

                Next,
          we determine the end behaviour of the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m>.
                Since the degree of the numerator is <m>1</m>,
                and the degree of the denominator is <m>2</m>,
                <xref ref="hathm">Theorem</xref>
                tells us that <m>y=0</m> is the horizontal asymptote.
                As with the vertical asymptotes,
                we can glean more detailed information using <q>number sense</q>.
                For the discussion below,
                we use the formula <m>f(x) = \dfrac{3x}{x^2-4}</m>.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      <em>The behaviour of <m>y=f(x)</m> as <m>x \rightarrow -\infty</m>:</em>
                      If we were to make a table of values to discuss the behaviour of <m>f</m> as <m>x \rightarrow -\infty</m>,
                      we would substitute very <q>large</q>
                      negative numbers in for <m>x</m>,
                      say for example,
          <m>x = \mbox{<m>-1</m> billion}</m>.
                      The numerator <m>3x</m> would then be <m>-3 \, \mbox{billion}</m>,
                      whereas the denominator <m>x^2-4</m> would be <m>(\mbox{<m>-1</m> billion} )^2 - 4</m>,
                      which is pretty much the same as  <m>1(\mbox{billion} )^2</m>.
                      Hence,
                      <me>
                        f\left(\mbox{\(-1\) billion} \right) \approx \dfrac{-3 \, \mbox{billion} }{1(\mbox{billion} )^2} \approx - \dfrac{3}{\mbox{billion} } \approx \mbox{very small \((-)\)}
                      </me>
                      Notice that if we substituted in <m>x = \mbox{<m>-1</m> trillion}</m>,
                      essentially the same kind of cancellation would happen,
                      and we would be left with an even
                      <q>smaller</q> negative number.
                      This not only confirms the fact that as <m>x \rightarrow -\infty</m>,
                      <m>f(x) \rightarrow 0</m>,
                it tells us that <m>f(x) \rightarrow 0^{-}</m>.
                      In other words,
                      the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> is a little bit <em>below</em>
                      the <m>x</m>-axis as we move to the far left.

                      we can imagine substituting very large positive numbers in for <m>x</m> and looking at the behaviour of <m>f(x)</m>.
                      For example, let <m>x = \mbox{<m>1</m> billion}</m>.
                      Proceeding as before, we get
                      <me>
                        f\left(\mbox{\(1\) billion} \right) \approx \dfrac{3 \, \mbox{billion} }{1(\mbox{billion} )^2} \approx \dfrac{3}{\mbox{billion} } \approx \mbox{very small \((+)\)}
                      </me>
                      The larger the number we put in,
                      the smaller the positive number we would get out.
                      In other words, as <m>x \rightarrow \infty</m>,
                      <m>f(x) \rightarrow 0^{+}</m>,
                      so the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> is a little bit <em>above</em>
                      the <m>x</m>-axis as we look toward the far right.

                Lastly, we construct a sign diagram for <m>f(x)</m>.
                The <m>x</m>-values excluded from the domain of <m>f</m> are <m>x = \pm 2</m>,
                and the only zero of <m>f</m> is <m>x=0</m>.
                Displaying these appropriately on the number line gives us four test intervals,
                and we choose the test values <m>x=-3</m>,
                <m>x=-1</m>, <m>x=1</m> and <m>x=3</m>.
                We find <m>f(-3)</m> is <m>(-)</m>,
                <m>f(-1)</m> is <m>(+)</m>,
                <m>f(1)</m> is <m>(-)</m> and <m>f(3)</m> is <m>(+)</m>.
                Combining this with our previous work,
                we get the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> in <xref ref="fig_ratgraph4">Figure</xref>. <figure xml:id="fig_ratsd2"> <caption>The sign diagram for

    <p>
      A couple of notes are in order.
      First, the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> certainly seems to possess symmetry with respect to the origin.
      In fact, we can check <m>f(-x) = -f(x)</m> to see that <m>f</m> is an odd function.
      In some textbooks,
      checking for symmetry is part of the standard procedure for graphing rational functions;
      but since it happens comparatively rarely we'll just point it out when we see it.
      Also note that while <m>y=0</m> is the horizontal asymptote,
      the graph of <m>f</m> actually crosses the <m>x</m>-axis at <m>(0,0)</m>.
      The myth that graphs of rational functions can't cross their horizontal asymptotes is completely false, (that's why we called it a MYTH!) as we shall see again in our next example.

                Since the degrees of the numerator and denominator of <m>g(x)</m> are the same,
                we know from <xref ref="hathm">Theorem</xref>
                that we can find the horizontal asymptote of the graph of <m>g</m> by taking the ratio of the leading terms coefficients,
                <m>y = \frac{2}{1} = 2</m>.
                However,
          if we take the time to do a more detailed analysis,
                we will be able to reveal some <q>hidden</q>
                behaviour which would be lost otherwise.(That is,
                if you use a calculator to graph.
                Once again, Calculus is the ultimate graphing power tool.)  As in the discussion following <xref ref="hathm">Theorem</xref>,
                we use the result of the long division <m>\left(2x^2-3x-5\right) \div \left(x^2-x-6\right)</m> to rewrite
                <m>g(x) = \dfrac{2x^2-3x-5}{x^2-x-6}</m> as <m>g(x) = 2 - \dfrac{x-7}{x^2-x-6}</m>.

                          However, compared to (<m>1</m> billion)<m>^{2}</m>,
                          it's on the insignificant side;
                          it's <m>10^{18}</m> versus <m>10^9</m>.
                          We are once again using the fact that for polynomials,
                          end behaviour is determined by the leading term,
                so in the denominator,
                          the <m>x^2</m> term wins out over the <m>x</m> term.

                      To consider <m>\dfrac{x-7}{x^2-x-6}</m> as <m>x \rightarrow \infty</m>,
                      we imagine substituting <m>x = \mbox{<m>1</m> billion}</m> and,

                      in other words,

            <li>
              <p>
                Finally we construct our sign diagram.
                We place an <q>\textinterrobang</q>
                above <m>x=-2</m> and <m>x=3</m>,
                and a <q><m>0</m></q>
                above <m>x = \frac{5}{2}</m> and <m>x=-1</m>.
                Choosing test values in the test intervals gives us <m>f(x)</m> is <m>(+)</m> on the intervals <m>(-\infty, -2)</m>,
                <m>\left(-1, \frac{5}{2}\right)</m> and <m>(3, \infty)</m>,
                and <m>(-)</m> on the intervals <m>(-2,-1)</m> and <m>\left(\frac{5}{2}, 3\right)</m>,
                giving us the sign diagram in <xref ref="fig_ratsd3">Figure</xref>.
                As we piece together all of the information,
                we note that the graph must cross the horizontal asymptote at some point after <m>x=3</m> in order for it to approach <m>y=2</m> from underneath.
                This is the subtlety that we would have missed had we skipped the long division and subsequent end behaviour analysis.
                We can,
          in fact, find exactly when the graph crosses <m>y=2</m>.
                As a result of the long division,
                we have <m>g(x) = 2 - \dfrac{x-7}{x^2-x-6}</m>.
                For <m>g(x) = 2</m>, we would need <m>\dfrac{x-7}{x^2-x-6} = 0</m>.
                This gives <m>x-7= 0</m>, or <m>x=7</m>.
                Note that <m>x-7</m> is the remainder when
                <m>2x^2-3x-5</m> is divided by <m>x^2-x-6</m>,
                so it makes sense that for <m>g(x)</m> to equal the quotient <m>2</m>,
                the remainder from the division must be <m>0</m>.
                Sure enough, we find <m>g(7)=2</m>.
                Moreover,
          it stands to reason that <m>g</m> must attain a relative minimum at some point past <m>x=7</m>.
                Calculus verifies that at <m>x=13</m>,
                we have such a minimum at exactly
                <m>(13, 1.96)</m>. <figure xml:id="fig_ratgraph7"> <caption>The complete graph

              For domain, you know the drill.
              Solving <m>x^2+3x+2 = 0</m> gives <m>x = -2</m> and <m>x=-1</m>.
              Our answer is <m>(-\infty, -2) \cup (-2, -1) \cup (-1, \infty)</m>.

          <li>
            <p>
              To reduce <m>h(x)</m>, we need to factor the numerator and denominator.
              To factor the numerator,
              we use the techniques set forth in <xref ref="RealZeros">Section</xref> and we get
              <md>
                <mrow>h(x) \amp  =  \dfrac{2x^3+5x^2+4x+1}{x^2+3x+2} = \dfrac{(2x+1)(x+1)^2}{(x+2)(x+1)}</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp  = \dfrac{ (2x+1) (x+1)^{\cancelto{1}{2}}  }{(x+2)\cancel{(x+1)}} = \dfrac{(2x+1)(x+1)}{x+2}</mrow>
              </md>
              We will use this reduced formula for <m>h(x)</m> as long as we're not substituting <m>x=-1</m>.
              To make this exclusion specific,
              we write <m>h(x) = \dfrac{(2x+1)(x+1)}{x+2}</m>, <m>x \neq -1</m>.

          <li>
            <p>
              To find the <m>x</m>-intercepts, as usual,
              we set <m>h(x) = 0</m> and solve.
              Solving <m>\dfrac{(2x+1)(x+1)}{x+2}=0</m> yields <m>x=-\frac{1}{2}</m> and <m>x=-1</m>.
              The latter isn't in the domain of <m>h</m>, so we exclude it.
              Our only <m>x</m>-intercept is <m>\left(-\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)</m>.
              To find the <m>y</m>-intercept, we set <m>x=0</m>.
              Since <m>0 \neq -1</m>,
              we can use the reduced formula for <m>h(x)</m> and we get
              <m>h(0) = \frac{1}{2}</m> for a <m>y</m>-intercept of <m>\left(0,\frac{1}{2}\right)</m>.

              From <xref ref="vavshole">Theorem</xref>,
              we know that since <m>x=-2</m> still poses a threat in the denominator of the reduced function,
              we have a vertical asymptote there.
              As for <m>x=-1</m>,
              the factor <m>(x+1)</m> was cancelled from the denominator when we reduced <m>h(x)</m>,
              so it no longer causes trouble there.
              This means that we get a hole when <m>x=-1</m>.
              To find the <m>y</m>-coordinate of the hole,
              we substitute <m>x=-1</m> into <m>\dfrac{(2x+1)(x+1)}{x+2}</m>,
              per <xref ref="vavshole">Theorem</xref> and get <m>0</m>.
              Hence, we have a hole on the <m>x</m>-axis at <m>(-1,0)</m>.
              It should make you uncomfortable plugging <m>x=-1</m> into the reduced formula for <m>h(x)</m>,
              especially since we've made such a big deal concerning the stipulation about not letting <m>x=-1</m> for that formula.
              What we are really doing is taking a Calculus short-cut to the more detailed kind of analysis near <m>x=-1</m> which we will show below.
              Speaking of which, for the discussion that follows,
              we will use the formula <m>h(x) = \dfrac{(2x+1)(x+1)}{x+2}</m>,
              <m>x \neq -1</m>.

                    we imagine substituting a number a little bit less than <m>-2</m>.
                    We have <m>h(x) \approx \frac{(-3)(-1)}{(\mbox{\scriptsize very small <m>(-)</m>} )} \approx \frac{3}{(\mbox{\scriptsize very small <m>(-)</m>} )}\approx \mbox{very big <m>(-)</m>}</m> thus as <m>x \rightarrow -2^{-}</m>,

                    As <m>x \rightarrow -1^{-}</m>,
                    we imagine plugging in a number a bit less than <m>x=-1</m>.
                    We have <m>h(x) \approx \frac{(-1)(\mbox{\scriptsize very small <m>(-)</m>} )}{1} = \mbox{very small <m>(+)</m>}</m> Hence,
                    as <m>x \rightarrow -1^{-}</m>,
                    <m>h(x) \rightarrow 0^{+}</m>.
                    This means that as <m>x \rightarrow -1^{-}</m>,
                    the graph is a bit above the point <m>(-1,0)</m>.
                    As <m>x \rightarrow -1^{+}</m>,
                    we get <m>h(x) \approx \frac{(-1)(\mbox{\scriptsize very small <m>(+)</m>} )}{1} = \mbox{very small <m>(-)</m>}</m>.
                    This gives us that as <m>x \rightarrow -1^{+}</m>,
                    <m>h(x) \rightarrow 0^{-}</m>,
                    so the graph is a little bit lower than <m>(-1,0)</m> here.

              <m>2x^3+5x^2+4x+1</m>,
              is <m>3</m> and the degree of the denominator, <m>x^2+3x+2</m>,
              is <m>2</m> so by <xref ref="sathm">Theorem</xref>,
              the graph of <m>y = h(x)</m> has a slant asymptote.
              For <m>x\rightarrow \pm \infty</m>,
              we are far enough away from <m>x=-1</m> to use the reduced formula,
              <m>h(x) = \dfrac{(2x+1)(x+1)}{x+2}</m>, <m>x \neq -1</m>.
              To perform long division,
              we multiply out the numerator and get <m>h(x) = \dfrac{2x^2+3x+1}{x+2}</m>,
              <m>x \neq -1</m>,
              and rewrite <m>h(x) = 2x-1+\dfrac{3}{x+2}</m>, <m>x \neq -1</m>.
              By <xref ref="sathm">Theorem</xref>,
              the slant asymptote is <m>y = 2x-1</m>,
              and to better see <em>how</em>
              the graph approaches the asymptote,
              we focus our attention on the term generated from the remainder,

        <p>
          We could ask whether the graph of <m>y=h(x)</m> crosses its slant asymptote.
          From the formula <m>h(x) = 2x-1+\dfrac{3}{x+2}</m>, <m>x \neq -1</m>,
          we see that if <m>h(x) = 2x-1</m>,
          we would have <m>\dfrac{3}{x+2} = 0</m>.
          Since this will never happen,
          we conclude the graph never crosses its slant asymptote. (But rest assured,
          some graphs do!)

    <p>
      We end this section with an example that shows it's not all pathological weirdness when it comes to rational functions and technology still has a role to play in studying their graphs at this level (that is,
      prior to introducing the techniques of Calculus).

      <title>A graph requiring calculus for the details</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Sketch the graph of <m>r(x) = \dfrac{x^4+1}{x^2+1}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              The denominator <m>x^2+1</m> is never zero so the domain is <m>(-\infty, \infty)</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              With no real zeros in the denominator,
              <m>x^2+1</m> is an irreducible quadratic.
              Our only hope of reducing <m>r(x)</m> is if <m>x^2+1</m> is a factor of <m>x^4+1</m>.
              Performing long division gives us
              <me>
                \dfrac{x^4+1}{x^2+1} = x^2-1+\dfrac{2}{x^2+1}
              </me>
              The remainder is not zero so <m>r(x)</m> is already reduced.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              To find the <m>x</m>-intercept, we'd set <m>r(x) = 0</m>.
              Since there are no real solutions to <m>\dfrac{x^4+1}{x^2+1}=0</m>,
              we have no <m>x</m>-intercepts.
              Since <m>r(0) = 1</m>, we get <m>(0,1)</m> as the <m>y</m>-intercept.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              This step doesn't apply to <m>r</m>,
              since its domain is all real numbers.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              For end behaviour,
              we note that since the degree of the numerator is exactly <em>two</em>
              more than the degree of the denominator,
              neither <xref ref="hathm">Theorems</xref>
              <xref ref="sathm">nor</xref> apply.
              We know from our attempt to reduce <m>r(x)</m> that we can rewrite <m>r(x) = x^2-1+\dfrac{2}{x^2+1}</m>,
              so we focus our attention on the term corresponding to the remainder,
              <m>\dfrac{2}{x^2+1}</m> It should be clear that as <m>x \rightarrow \pm \infty</m>,
              <m>\dfrac{2}{x^2+1} \approx \mbox{very small <m>(+)</m>}</m>,
              which means <m>r(x) \approx x^2-1 + \mbox{very small <m>(+)</m>}</m>.
              So the graph <m>y=r(x)</m> is a little bit <em>above</em>
              the graph of the parabola <m>y=x^2-1</m> as <m>x \rightarrow \pm \infty</m>.
              Graphically,
              we have <xref ref="fig_ratgraph11">Figure</xref>. <figure xml:id="fig_ratgraph11"> <caption>Comparing <m>y=r(x)</m> to <m>y=x^2-1</m></caption> <img src="figures/RationalsGraphics/RationalGraphs-15.pdf"/> </figure>

          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              There isn't much work to do for a sign diagram for <m>r(x)</m>,
              since its domain is all real numbers and it has no zeros.
              Our sole test interval is <m>(-\infty, \infty)</m>,
              and since we know <m>r(0) = 1</m>,
              we conclude <m>r(x)</m> is <m>(+)</m> for all real numbers.
              At this point, we don't have much to go on for a graph.
              We leave it to the reader to show
              <m>r(-x) = r(x)</m> so <m>r</m> is even, and,
              hence, its graph is symmetric about the <m>y</m>-axis.

              We have no way to detect the relative extrema analytically
              (without appealing to Calculus, of course)
              apart from brute force plotting of points,
              which is done more efficiently by the computer.

      As usual, the authors offer no apologies for what may be construed as
      <q>pedantry</q> in this section.
      We feel that the detail presented in this section is necessary to obtain a firm grasp of the concepts presented here and it also serves as an introduction to the methods employed in Calculus.
      As we have said many times in the past,
      your instructor will decide how much, if any,
      of the kinds of details presented here are
      <q>mission critical</q>
      to your understanding of Precalculus.

      showed us that the six-step procedure cannot tell us everything of importance about the graph of a rational function.
      Without Calculus,
      we need to use technology to reveal the hidden mysteries of rational function behaviour.
      Working with your classmates,
      use a computer or graphing calculator to examine the graphs of the rational functions given in Exercises} {. Compare and contrast their features.
      Which features can the six-step process reveal and which features cannot be detected by it?}
